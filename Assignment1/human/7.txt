Machine learning
Machine learning
 (
ML
) is a 
field of study
 in 
artificial intelligence
 concerned with the
development and study of 
statistical algorithms
 that can learn from 
data
 and 
generalize
 to
unseen data and thus perform 
tasks
 without explicit 
instructions
.

 Recently, 
artificial neural
ne tw orks
 have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.

ML finds application in many fields, including 
natural language processing
, 
computer vision
,
speech recognition
, 
email filtering
, 
agriculture
, and medicine.

 When applied to business
problems, it is known under the name 
predictive analytics
. Although not all machine learning is
statistically
 based, 
computational statistics
 is an important source of the field's methods.
The mathematical foundations of ML are provided by 
mathematical optimization
 (mathematical
programming) methods. 
Data mining
 is a related (parallel) field of study, focusing on
exploratory data analysis
 (EDA) through 
unsupervised learning
.

From a theoretical viewpoint, 
probably approximately correct (PAC) learning
 provides a
framework for describing machine learning.
The term 
machine learning
 was coined in 1959 by 
Arthur Samuel
, an 
IBM
 employee and
pioneer in the field of 
computer gaming
 and 
artificial intelligence
.

 The synonym

teaching computers
 was also used in this time period.

Although the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when 
Arthur Samuel
invented a 
program
 that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, the history of
machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive
processes.
[
12
]
 In 1949, 
Canadian
 psychologist 
Donald Hebb
 published the book 
The
Organization of Behavior
, in which he introduced a 
theoretical neural structure
 formed by
certain interactions among 
ne rve  ce lls
.
[
13
]
 Hebb's model of 
ne urons
 interacting with one
another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or
artificial neurons
 used by computers to communicate data.
[

 Other researchers who have
studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as
well, including logician 
Walter Pitts
 and 
Warre n M c C u l l o c h
, who proposed the early
mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human
thought processes.

By the early 1960s an experimental "learning machine" with 
punched tape
 memory, called
Cybertron, had been developed by 
Raytheon Company
 to analyze 
sonar
 signals,
electrocardiograms
, and speech patterns using rudimentary 
reinforcement learning
. It  w as
repetitively "trained" by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a
"
goof
" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions.

 A representative book on research

Machine learning as subÞeld of

[

into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing
mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.
[
15
]
 Interest related to pattern
recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973.
[
16
]
 In 1981 a
report was given on using teaching strategies so that an 
artificial neural network
 learns to
recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.
[
17
]
Tom M. Mitchell
 provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in
the machine learning field: "A computer program is said to learn from experience 
E
 with respect
to some class of tasks 
T
 and performance measure 
P
 if its performance at tasks in 
T
, as
me asure d by 
P
, 
improves with experience 
E
."
[
18
]
 This definition of the tasks in which machine
learning is concerned offers a fundamentally 
operational definition
 rather than defining the
field in cognitive terms. This follows 
Alan Turing
's proposal in his paper "
Computing Machinery
and Intelligence
", in which the question "Can machines think?" is replaced with the question
"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?".
[
19
]
Modern-day machine learning has two objectives. 
One is to classify data based on models which
have been developed; the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on
these models. A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of
moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles. A
machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential
predictions.
[

As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the
qu e s t  f o r 
artificial intelligence
 (AI). In the early days of AI as
an 
academic discipline
, some researchers were interested in
having machines learn from data. They attempted to
approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as
well as what were then termed "
ne ural ne tw orks
"; these
were mostly 
perceptrons
 and 
other models
 that were later
found to be reinventions of the 
generalized linear models
 of
statistics.
[

Probabilistic reasoning
 was also employed,
especially in 
automated medical diagnosis
.

However, an increasing emphasis on the 
logical, knowledge-
based approach
 caused a rift between AI and machine
learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical
and practical problems of data acquisition and
representation.

 By 1980, 
expert systems
 had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out
of favor.
[
24
]
 Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to
inductive logic programming
(ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the

 Neural
networks research had been abandoned by AI and 
computer science
 around the same time. This
line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as "
connectionism
", by researchers from other
disciplines including 
Hopfield
, 
Rumelhart
, and  
Hinton
. Their main success came in the mid-
1980s with the reinvention of 
backpropagation
.

Machine learning (ML), reorganized and recognized as its own field, started to flourish in the
1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable
problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the 
symbolic approaches
 it had
inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics, 
fuzzy logic
, and
probability theory
.
[

There is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts
the 
posterior probabilities
 of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data
compression (by using 
arithmetic coding
 on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal
compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the
previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression
as a benchmark for "general intelligence".
[
25
]
[
26
]
[
27
]
An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit
feature space vectors
, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within
these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space 
!
, such that
C(.) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive
examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space;
instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods,
LZW, LZ7 7 , and  PPM .
[
28
]
According to 
AIX I
 theory, a connection more directly explained in 
Hutter Prize
, the best
possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that
model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since
you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form.
Examples of AI-powered audio/video compression software include 
NVIDIA Maxine
, AIVC .
[
29
]
Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression include 
OpenCV
,
Te nsorFlow
, 
MATLAB
's Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image
Compression.
[
30
]
In 
unsupervised machine learning
, 
k-means clustering
 can be utilized to compress data by
grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets
that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as 
image compression
.
[
31
]
Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and
speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning
algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each
represented by the 
centroid
 of its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more
Data compression
compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in 
image
 and 
signal processing
, k-
means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids,
thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the
required storage space.
[
32
]
Larg e  l ang u ag e  mo d e l s
 (LLMs) are also capable of lossless data compression, as demonstrated
by 
DeepMind
's research with the Chinchilla 70B model. Developed by DeepMind, Chinchilla
70B effectively compressed data, outperforming conventional methods such as 
Portable
Network Graphics
 (PNG) for images and 
Free Lossless Audio Codec
 (FLAC) for audio. It
achieved compression of image and audio data to 43.4% and 16.4% of their original sizes,
respectively.
[

Machine learning and 
data mining
 often employ the same methods and overlap significantly,
but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on 
know n
 properties learned from the
training data, data mining focuses on the 
discovery
 of (previously) 
unknown
 properties in the
data (this is the analysis step of 
knowledge discovery
 in databases). Data mining uses many
machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also
employs data mining methods as "
unsupervised learning
" or as a preprocessing step to improve
learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do
often have separate conferences and separate journals, 
ECML PKDD
 being a major exception)
comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually
evaluated with respect to the ability to 
reproduce known
 knowledge, while in knowledge
discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously 
unknown
knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method
will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task,
supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.
Machine learning also has intimate ties to 
optimization
: Many learning problems are
formulated as minimization of some 
loss function
 on a training set of examples. Loss functions
express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual
problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and
models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples).
[
34
]
Characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current
research, especially for 
deep learning
 algorithms.
Machine learning and 
statistics
 are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in
their principal goal: statistics draws population 
inferences
 from a 
sample
, while machine
learning finds generalizable predictive patterns.
[
35
]
 According to 
Michael I. Jordan
, the ideas of
Data mining
Generalization
Statistics
machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-
history in statistics.
[
36
]
 He also suggested the term 
data science
 as a placeholder to call the
overall field.
[
36
]
Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the
study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous
experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-
structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more
variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be.
[
37
]
Leo Breiman
 distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms: data model and algorithmic
mode l,
[
38
]
 wherein "algorithmic model" means more or less the machine learning algorithms
like 
Rand om Fore st
.
Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field
that they call 
statistical learning
.
[
39
]
Analytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered
systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyze
the weight space of 
deep neural networks
.
[
40
]
 Statistical physics is thus finding applications in
the area of 
medical diagnostics
.
[
41
]
A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience.
[
5
]
[
42
]
 Generalization in this
context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen
examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from
some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of
occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to
produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.
The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch
of 
theoretical computer science
 known as 
computational learning theory
 via the 
Probably
Approximately Correct Learning
 (PAC) model. Because training sets are finite and the future is
uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms.
Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The 
biasÐvariance
decomposition
 is one way to quantify generalization 
error
.
For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis
should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less
complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the
model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too
complex, then the model is subject to 
overfitting
 and generalization will be poorer.
[

Statistical physics
Theory
A 
support-vector machine
 is a
supervised learning model that
divides the data into regions
separated by a 
linear boundary
.
Here, the linear boundary divides
the black circles from the white.
In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility
of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be
done in 
polynomial time
. There are two kinds of 
time complexity
 results: Positive results show
that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that
certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.
Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which
correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the "signal" or "feedback"
available to the learning system:
Supervised learning
: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired
outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that 
maps
 inputs to
outputs.
Unsupervised learning
: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to
Þnd structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden
patterns in data) or a means towards an end (
feature learning
).
Reinforcement learning
: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which
it must perform a certain goal (such as 
driving a vehicle
 or playing a game against an
opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's
analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize.
[
5
]
Although each algorithm has advantages and limitations, no single algorithm works for all
problems.
[
44
]
[
45
]
[
46
]
Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model
of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired
outputs.
[
47
]
 The data, known as 
training data
, consists of a
set of training examples. Each training example has one or
more inputs and the desired output, also known as a
supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training
example is represented by an 
array
 or vector, sometimes
called a 
feature vector
, and the training data is represented
by a 
matrix
. Through 
iterative optimization
 of an 
objective
function
, supervised learning algorithms learn a function
that can be used to predict the output associated with new
inputs.
[
48
]
 An optimal function allows the algorithm to
correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a
part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the
accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to
have learned to perform that task.
[
18
]
Approaches
Supervised learning
Clustering via Large Indel Permuted Slopes, CLIPS,
[
53
]
 turns the alignment image into a
learning regression problem. The varied slope (
b
) estimates between each pair of DNA
segments enables to identify segments sharing the same set of indels.
Types of supervised-learning algorithms include 
active learning
, 
classification
 and 
regression
.
[
49
]
 Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values,
and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a
range. As an example, for a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an
incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email.
Examples of regression would be predicting the height of a person, or the future temperature.
[
50
]
Similarity learning
 is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and
classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures
how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in 
ranking
, 
recommendation systems
,
visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.
Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labeled, classified or
categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify
commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in
each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include
clustering, 
dimensionality reduction
,
[
7
]
 and 
density estimation
.
[
51
]
 Unsupervised learning
algorithms also streamlined the process of identifying large 
indel
 based 
haplotypes
 of a gene of
interest from 
pan-genome
.
[
52
]
Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called 
cl u s t er s
) so that
observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated
criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering
techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some
similarity metric
 and evaluated, for example, by 
internal compactness
, or the similarity
between members of the same cluster, and 
separation
, the difference between clusters. Other
methods are based on 
es t i m at ed  d ens i t y
 and 
gr aph connecti vi ty
.
A special type of unsupervised learning called, 
self-supervised learning
 involves training a
model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself.
[
54
]
[
55
]
Unsupervised learning
Semi-supervised learning
Semi-supervised learning falls between 
unsupervised learning
 (without any labeled training
data) and 
supervised learning
 (with completely labeled training data). Some of the training
examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that
unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a
considerable improvement in learning accuracy.
In 
weakly supervised learning
, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however,
these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.
[
56
]
Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how 
software agents
ought to take 
actions
 in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.
Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as 
game theory
, 
control
theory
, 
operations research
, 
information theory
, 
simulation-based optimization
, 
multi-agent
systems
, 
swarm intelligence
, 
statistics
 and 
genetic algorithms
. In reinforcement learning, the
environment is typically represented as a 
Markov decision process
 (MDP). Many
reinforcements learning algorithms use 
dynamic programming
 techniques.
[
57
]
 Reinforcement
learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and
are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in
autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.
Dimensionality reduction
 is a process of reducing the number of random variables under
consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.
[
58
]
 In other words, it is a process of
reducing the dimension of the 
feature
 set, also called the "number of features". Most of the
dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or
extraction
. One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is 
principal component
analysis
 (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space
(e.g., 2D). The 
manifold hypothesis
 proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-
dimensional 
manifolds
, and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption,
leading to the area of 
manifold learning
 and 
manifold regularization
.
Other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold
categorization, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system. For
example, 
topic modeling
, 
meta-learning
.

Self-learning, as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural
network capable of self-learning, named 
cr o s s bar  ad ap t i v e ar r ay
 (CAA).
[
60
]
 It is learning with
no external rewards and no external teacher advice. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes,
in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence

situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.
[
61
]
 The self-
learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes
the following machine learning routine:
1. 
in situation 
s
 perform action 
a
2. 
receive a consequence situation 
s'
3. 
compute emotion of being in the consequence situation 
v(s')
4. 
update crossbar memory 
w'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s')
It is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behavior) a. There
is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The
backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence
situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioral environment where it
behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives
initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment. After
receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-
seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.
[
62
]
Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided
during training.
[
63
]
 Classic examples include 
principal component analysis
 and cluster analysis.
Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to
preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often
as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows
reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not
being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This
re p lace s manu al 
feature engineering
, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use
them to perform a specific task.
Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning,
features are learned using labeled input data. Examples include 
artificial neural networks
,
multilayer perceptrons
, and supervised 
dictionary learning
. In unsupervised feature learning,
features are learned with unlabeled input data. 
Examples include dictionary learning,
independent component analysis
, 
autoe ncode rs
, 
matrix factorization
[
64
]
 and various forms of
clustering
.
[
65
]
[

[
67
]
Manifold learning
 algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned
representation is low-dimensional. 
Sparse coding
 algorithms attempt to do so under the
constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has
many ze ros. 
Multilinear subspace learning
 algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional
representations directly from 
tensor
 representations for multidimensional data, without
reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors.
[
68
]
 
Deep learning
 algorithms discover multiple
levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features
defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent
machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation
that explain the observed data.
[
69
]
Feature learning
Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often
require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-
world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically
define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through
examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.
Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented
as a linear combination of 
basis functions
 and assumed to be a 
sparse matrix
. The method is
strongly NP-hard
 and difficult to solve approximately.
[
70
]
 A popular 
heuristic
 method for sparse
dictionary learning is the 
k
-SVD
 algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in
several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously
unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a
new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the
corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in 
image de-noising
.
The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but
the noise cannot.
[
71
]
In 
data mining
, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare
items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority
of the data.
[
72
]
 Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as 
bank fraud
, a
structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as 
outliers
,
novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.
[
73
]
In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are
often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the
common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in
particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately.
Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these
patterns.
[
74
]
Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.
[
75
]
 Unsupervised anomaly
detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that
the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit
the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a
data set that has been labeled as "normal" and "abnormal" and involves training a classifier (the
key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced
nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model
representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood
of a test instance to be generated by the model.

Robot learning
Robot learning
 is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from
supervised learning, reinforcement learning,
[
76
]
[
77
]
 and finally 
meta-learning
 (e.g. MAML).
Association rule learning is a 
rule-based machine learning
 method for discovering relationships
between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in
databases using some measure of "interestingness".
[

Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies,
learns, or evolves "rules" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of
a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational
rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to
other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be
universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.
[

 Rule-based machine
learning approaches include 
learning classifier systems
, association rule learning, and 
artificial
immune systems
.
Based on the concept of strong rules, 
Rakesh Agrawal
, 
Tomasz Imieli
!
ski
 and Arun Swami
introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale
transaction data recorded by 
point-of-sale
 (POS) systems in supermarkets.
[
80
]
 For example, the
ru le  
 found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate
that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger
meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as
promotional 
pricing
 or 
product placements
. In addition to 
market basket analysis
, association
rules are employed today in application areas including 
Web usage mining
, 
intrusion detection
,
continuous production
, and  
bioinformatics
. In contrast with 
sequence mining
, association rule
learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across
transactions.
Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that
combine a discovery component, typically a 
genetic algorithm
, with a learning component,
performing either 
supervised learning
, 
reinforcement learning
, o r 
unsupervised learning
. They
seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a
piecewise
 manner in order to make predictions.

Inductive logic programming
 (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using 
logic programming
 as a
uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an
encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical
database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that 
entails
 all positive
and no negative examples. 
Inductive programming
 is a related field that considers any kind of
programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as
functional programs
.
Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in 
bioinformatics
 and 
natural lang uag e
processing

A 
machine learning model
 is a type of 
mathematical model
 that, after being "trained" on a
given dataset, can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data. During training, a
learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the model's internal parameters to minimize errors in its
predictions.
[
86
]
 By extension, the term "model" can refer to several levels of specificity, from a
general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all
its internal parameters tuned.
[
87
]
Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems, picking
the best model for a task is called 
model selection
.
Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or
connectionist
 systems, are computing systems
vaguely inspired by the 
biological neural
ne tw orks
 that constitute animal 
brains
. Such
systems "learn" to perform tasks by considering
examples, generally without being programmed
with any task-specific rules.
An ANN is a model based on a collection of
connected units or nodes called "
artificial
ne urons
", which loosely model the 
ne urons
 in a
biological brain. Each connection, like the
synapses
 in a biological brain, can transmit
information, a "signal", from one artificial
neuron to another. An artificial neuron that
receives a signal can process it and then signal
additional artificial neurons connected to it. In
common ANN implementations, the signal at a
connection between artificial neurons is a 
re al
numbe r
, and the output of each artificial neuron
is computed by some non-linear function of the
sum of its inputs. The connections between
artificial neurons are called "edges". Artificial
neurons and edges typically have a 
weight
 that
adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight
increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a
threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold.
Models
ArtiÞcial neural networks

Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different
kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to
the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.
The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a 
human
brain
 would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to
deviations from 
biology
. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks,
including 
computer vision
, 
speech recognition
, 
machine translation
, 
social network
 filtering,
playing board and video games
 and 
medical diagnosis
.
Deep learning
 consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach
tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some
successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.

Decision tree learning uses a 
decision tree
 as a 
predictive
mode l
 to go from observations about an item (represented
in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value
(represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive
modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and
machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can
take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in
these tree structures, 
leaves
 represent class labels, and
branches represent 
conjunctions
 of features that lead to
those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable
can take continuous values (typically 
re al nu mbe rs
) are
called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree
can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and
decision making
. In data mining, a decision tree describes
data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for
decision-making.
Support-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of related
supervised learning
 methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training
examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds
a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category.
[
89
]
 An SVM training
algorithm is a non-
probabilistic
, 
binary
, 
linear classifier
, although methods such as 
Platt scaling
exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear
classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the
kernel trick
, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.

Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of
statistical methods to estimate the relationship
between input variables and their associated
features. Its most common form is 
linear
regression
, where a single line is drawn to best fit
the given data according to a mathematical
criterion such as 
ordinary least squares
. The latter
is often extended by 
regularization
 methods to
mitigate overfitting and bias, as in 
ridge
regression
. When dealing with non-linear
problems, go-to models include 
polynomial
regression
 (for example, used for trendline fitting
in Microsoft Excel
[
90
]
), 
logistic regression
 (often
used in 
statistical classification
) or even 
ke rne l
regression
, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the 
kernel trick
 to implicitly
map input variables to higher-dimensional space.
A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic
graphical model is a probabilistic 
graphical model

random variables
 and their 
conditional
independence
 with a 
directed acyclic graph
 (DAG). For
example, a Bayesian network could represent the
probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms.
Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the
probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient
algorithms exist that perform 
inference
 and learning.
Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like
speech signals
 or 
protein sequences
, are  c al l e d  
dynamic
Bayesian networks
. Generalizations of Bayesian networks
that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called 
influence diagrams

A Gaussian process is a 
stochastic process
 in which every
finite collection of the random variables in the process has a
multivariate normal distribution
, and it relies on a pre-
defined 
covariance function
, or kernel, that models how
pairs of points relate to each other depending on their
locations.
Given a set of observed points, or inputÐoutput examples,
the distribution of the (unobserved) output of a new point as
function of its input data can be directly computed by
Bayesian networks
Gaussian processes
looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new,
unobserved point.
Gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in

The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or DempsterÐShafer theory, is
a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other
frameworks such as 
probability
, 
possibility
 and 
imprecise probability theories
. These theoretical
frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how
evidence is combined (e.g., 
Dempster's rule of combination), just like how in a 
pmf
-based
Bayesian approach
 would combine probabilities. However, there are many caveats to these
beliefs functions when compared to Bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and
uncertainty quantification
. These belief function approaches that are implemented within the
machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various 
ensemble methods
 to
better handle the learner's 
decision boundary
, low samples, and ambiguous class issues that
standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving.
[

 However, the
computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions
(classes), and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine
learning approaches.
Typically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate
predictions. When training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to
target and collect a large and representative 
sample
 of data. Data from the training set can be as
varied as a 
corpus of text
, a collection of images, 
sensor
 data, and data collected from individual
users of a service. 
Overfitting
 is something to watch out for when training a machine learning
model. Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or
undesired predictions. Biased models may result in detrimental outcomes, thereby furthering
the negative impacts on society or objectives. 
Algorithmic bias
 is a potential result of data not
being fully prepared for training. Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and
notably, becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams.

Federated learning is an adapted form of 
distributed artificial intelligence
 to training machine
learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be
maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases
efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices. For example,

federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones
without having to send individual searches back to

Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to

Learners can also disappoint by "learning the wrong lesson".
A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on
pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that
all brown patches are likely to be horses.
[

 A real-world example is that, unlike humans,
current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship
between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans
are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying
these patterns on a legitimate image can result in "adversarial" images that the system
misclassifies.

Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern

Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques
like the 
holdout
 method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3
training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model
on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-
cross-validation
 method randomly partitions the data
into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for
evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and
cross-validation methods, 
bootstrap
, which samples n instances with replacement from the
dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.
[
146
]
In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report 
sensitivity and specificity
meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly,
investigators sometimes report the 
false positive rate
 (FPR) as well as the 
false negative rate
(FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators.
The 
total operating characteristic
 (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic
ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus
TOC provides more information than the commonly used 
receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) and ROC's associated area under the curve (AUC).

Machine learning poses a host of 
ethical questions
. Systems that are trained on datasets
collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (

 This is especially true in the United
States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also
increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with
unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There
is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to
diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be

The deÞnition "without being explicitly programmed" is often attributed to 
Arthur Samuel
,
who coined the term "machine learning" in 1959, but the phrase is not found verbatim in this
publication, and may be a 
paraphrase
 that appeared later. Confer "Paraphrasing Arthur
Samuel (1959), the question is: How can computers learn to solve problems without being
explicitly programmed?" in 
Koza, John R.; Bennett, Forrest H.; Andre, David; Keane, Martin
A. (1996). "Automated Design of Both the Topology and Sizing of Analog Electrical Circuits
Using Genetic Programming".
