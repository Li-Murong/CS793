Abstract
ŠThis paper is aimed at using the newly developing
eld of physics informed machine learning (PIML) to develop
models for predicting the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) aircraft
engines. We consider the well-known benchmark NASA Commer-
cial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS)
data as the main data for this paper, which consists of sensor
outputs in a variety of different operating modes. C-MAPSS is a
well-studied dataset with much existing work in the literature that
address RUL prediction with classical and deep learning methods.
In the absence of published empirical physical laws governing the
C-MAPSS data, our approach rst uses stochastic methods to
estimate the governing physics models from the noisy time series
data. In our approach, we model the various sensor readings
as being governed by stochastic differential equations, and we
estimate the corresponding transition density mean and variance
functions of the underlying processes. We then augment LSTM
(long-short term memory) models with the learned mean and
variance functions during training and inferencing. Our PIML
based approach is different from previous methods, and we use
the data to rst learn the physics. Our results indicate that PIML
discovery and solutions methods are well suited for this problem
and outperform previous data-only deep learning methods for
this data set and task. Moreover, the framework developed herein
is exible, and can be adapted to other situations (other sensor
modalities or combined multi-physics environments), including
cases where the underlying physics is only partially observed or
known.

Aircraft maintenance is a a critical component in ensuring
the safety, dependability, and efciency of aviation systems
and their operational modes ( [1]Œ[4]). Classical maintenance
methods, such as scheduled maintenance, aimed at corrective
repair/upkeep may still be relevant but are often plagued by
limitations such as operational (including logistic) disruptions,
periods of unavailability (downtime) and increased costs, for
even routine issues. On the other hand, predictive maintenance
(PM), which refers to maintenance approaches relying on data-
driven or data-augmented techniques, is a proactive set of
approaches that leverage past data (and modes) to foresee
system (or subsystem) failures prior to occurrence ( [5], [6]).
Work performed in Southwest Research Institute (SwRI)
Quantities of interest that may be part of a PM diagnosis
are probability of engine failure/stalls, estimating remaining
useful lifetime (RUL) of engines, probability of catastrophic
multi-system failure etc. A characteristic of PM systems are
real-time (or near real-time) information about the system
and dynamic updating of data to provide estimates when the
mission or ight is in progress. Moreover, these systems can
be incorporated into the ight system itself and not only in
separate command centers.
A. Salient Features:
Other important points to note about PM are:

Since PM systems are (near) real-time, they allow for
early detection and identication of aircraft degradation
or faulty functioning of aircraft subsystems. In the case
of commercial aircraft, this allows to potentially save
passenger lives by reducing the risk of dangerous mal-
function being unnoticed. PM allows for corrective, risk-
mitigation maneuvers on the part of pilots ( [5]).

When early onset of faulty system performance is picked
by PM diagnosis, this allows for action to be taken that
would help avoid further catastrophic outcomes such as
complete engine failure. This would help not only saving
human life, but also reduce total maintenance costs of the
mission/ight ( [3], [4]).

PM allows for addressing maintenance needs during
both scheduled and unscheduled periods. This in turn
minimizes any unplanned downtime of aircraft systems
and helps to optimize aircraft utilization.

Continuing the earlier remarks, early detection of system
malfunction allows for the use of maintenance resources
for mission-critical tasks. Thus, PM ensures the focus-
ing of in-depth maintenance efforts on aircraft/avionics
systems or components that are known to require atten-
tion, thereby optimizing the allotment of maintenance
resources. Finally, this helps to reduce costs overall in
maintenance.

As another means of reducing overall costs, PM re-
duces the chances of unexpected maintenance issues,
and thereby reduces operational delays (such as ight
arXiv:2406.15619v1  [cs.LG]  21 Jun 2024
delays, cancellation or diversions) which are known to
impact commercial airlines signicantly. For military
aircraft, operational delays may impact the efcacy of the
mission, and may even lead to a critical mission being
compromised ( [5]).

PM and ML/AI models: PM relies on innovative use
of sensor data from various aircraft systems, such as
engines, avionics, and airframes. These sensor readings
are fused via ML/AI techniques and processed to pre-
dict anomalous behavior, potential known or unknown
failures; further, in non-critical scenarios, the ML/AI
methods are used to monitor equipment health. Simply
put, the ML/AI techniques are trained on a large swathe
of past sensor data in order to detect/identify trends and
risk factors that are indicative of equipment failures or
system degradation. Once detected or identied, infor-
mation about these issues can be communicated to a
subject matter expert (SME) to determine the severity of
the issues and what corrective actions need to be taken (
[2]).

Regulatory agencies such as the Federal Aviation Admin-
istration (FAA) and the European Union Aviation Safety
Agency (EASA), have developed standards and regula-
tions that need to be met by commercial aircraft in order
for them to be ight worthy. PM techniques can be used
to augment existing risk management methods to further
ensure compliance with these regulatory standards.
There are several challenges to full-scale incorporation of
PM methods. First, data quality/integrity and interoperability
challenges often prevent the implementation of PM methods.
Scarce data or uneven data between different sensors limit the
applicability of PM techniques. Integrating real-time systems
on platform is a separate challenge, as the existing hardware
and infrastructure on aircraft needs to be sufcient for running
PM diagnostics. Finally, reliability of PM methods requires
extensive testing, and both commercial and military opera-
tors need to allocate sufcient resources to adequate testing.
However, these challenges can be surmounted with careful
analysis and a well-dened systems engineering approach
during design and development. The future directions of a
PM based eet are to include internet of things (IoT) devices
into PM data sources and the design of digital twins to further
improve the efcacy of PM.
PM is therefore an emerging, and continually evolving
paradigm in aircraft maintenance practices ( [1]). PM tech-
niques can be incorporated with other evolutions in the avi-
ation industry with newer hardware/sensing capabilities. PM
can then co-evolve to ensure the safety and reliability of ever
increasing complex aircraft systems. Moreover, the nancial
savings afforded by PM can be used to further increase aircraft
capabilities.
B. Physics Informed Machine Learning
Currently, a large amount of computational modeling is
based on deterministic models and/or multi-delity approx-
imate solutions that do not directly account for inherent
variability (stochasticity) in the material properties. When
predicting real-world expected performances, these models
are laboriously recomputed many times and deliver solutions
that do not generalize efciently to situations where the data
needed for simulations is partially observed. Moreover, real
experimental test data is a scarce commodity, so there is a
need to utilize such data in the most efcient way possible (
[7]).
1) PIML in a Nutshell:
Physics Informed Machine Learn-
ing (PIML) models offer a promising way forward for bal-
ancing computational delity and data-driven generalization.
PIML is a data driven ML modeling framework that is
augmented by the underlying scientic domain (mechanics,
electromagnetics, acoustics, thermal or multiphysics). Thus,
scientic knowledge captured by some relevant set of physi-
cal principle/equation (conservation laws, Maxwell equations,
mechanical properties, heat diffusion etc.) is directly integrated
with the ML modeling to predict quantities of interest (failure
of materials, energy transmission efciency, stress, drag etc.)
which are often needed for mission-critical decision making
( [7], [8]). PIML models achieve better generalization than
traditional ﬁdata onlyﬂ ML models since they can be viewed
as incorporating real-world prior knowledge (i.e. a Bayesian
reformulation). This also allows PIML models to operate
in low/partially observed data regimes where the physics-
informed component can act as data surrogate as needed. Due
to inherent regularization, PIML models are less prone to
spurious solutions while dealing with noisy data as well. Fi-
nally, PIML models yield more succinct models characterized
by fewer ML parameters while achieving (often exceeding)
the accuracy/efciency of complex ﬁdata onlyﬂ deep learning
models. This also renders th en more explainable than ﬁblack
boxﬂ ML models and is signicant when downstream decision
making requires explainable predictions ( [9], [10]).
2) Methodologies in Physics-Informed Machine Learning:
There are several ways in which PIML performed.

Differential Equation Constraints: PIML frameworks uti-
lize differential equations to incorporate dynamic system
behavior into machine learning models, facilitating time-
series forecasting, and dynamical system identication (
[10]).

Generative Data: Systems governed by stochastic differ-
ential equation (SDE) models can be used to perform
physics-informed data generation. This generated data
would capture well the underlying physics, and being a
data augmentation method, can directly be incorporated
into the ML modeling to ensure model robustness ( [11]).

Hybrid Physics-Data Models: Hybrid approaches are also
possible which integrate physics-based simu lations with
data-driven (ML) techniques, balancing model accuracy
and computational efciency ( [9]).
3) Modes of PIML Operation:
Roughly, PIML methods
operate in two modes. The rst is the ﬁdiscovery modeﬂ
wherein the physical parameters (coefcients of differential
equations, structural parameters etc.) are learning from the
underlying data. The second is the ﬁsolution modeﬂ which
uses a fully specied physical model along with a data-driven
component to drive predictions. The exact means by which
the two modes operate are largely problem/domain dependent,
and specic implementations of either mode of operation may
change widely across different areas ( [8], [11]).
4) Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs):
PINNs are
an exemplary class of PIML models. PINNs are deep neural
networks which are trained on a loss functions composed of
two components ( [8]). The rst is the usual data driven (often
mean square error MSE), while the other component is a
physics-informed one. The physics informed loss includes all
physical constraints of the problem include modeling choices,
differential/integral equations, boundary conditions, uncertain
coefcients etc. Both components of the overall loss work
in tandem to deliver a robust model. While PINNs are one
example of a class of PIML models, it is possible to have other
PIML approaches as well. In this regard,
PIML is a modeling
framework, rather than a specic set of model types
.
5) Applications of PIML:

Aerospace Engineering: PIML methods are very useful
for turbulence modeling, wing design and sh ape optimiza-
tion, where traditional computational methods such as
nite element/nite difference methods can be augmented
by data-driven models ( [9], [12]).

Mechanical Engineering: Applications in mechanical en-
gineering includes modeling of fatigue of materials, CFD,
elasticity etc. ( [9], [13], [14])

Material Science: PIML accelerates materials discov-
ery by integrating physics-based simulations with high-
throughput experimentation, guiding the design of novel
materials with desired properties ( [9], [15]).

Biomedical Engineering: PIML aids in medical image
analysis, patient monitoring, and drug discovery, lever-
aging physics-based models and clinical data to improve
diagnosis and treatment outcomes ( [16]Œ[18]).
Scalability of PIML methods to high-dimensional data remains
a challenge. Lower order modeling, model order reduction
methods, and surro gate models have proven to be promising
ways of mitigating this challenge ( [19]). Another area re-
quiring further investigation is uncertainty quantication (UQ)
of PIML predictions. UQ is needed for meaningful decision-
making and risk assessment, and robust methods for uncer-
tainty quantication and propagation are essential. Finally,
software packages for easy implementation of differential
equation solvers using deep learning methods are available
as well ( [20]).
C. Prior Work: Data-Driven Deep Learning for PM using the
C-MAPSS Dataset
In recent years, machine learning techniques, particularly
long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), have shown promise in PM applications.
Towards this end, the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion
System Simulation (C-MAPSS) dataset (a widely used bench-
mark dataset for prognostics and health management research)
is a standard dataset used for studying the efciency of ML
models for PM ( [21], [22]). C-MAPSS consists of multiple
simulated engine run-to-failure trajectories, each containing
sensor measurements and corresponding remaining useful life
(RUL) labels. The data con sists of multiple noisy time series
that correspond to sensor readings from different parts of an
aircraft engine. Thus far, the LSTM Networks and CNNs have
been well-studied architectures for PM usinng the C-MAPSS
dataset ( [23]Œ[26]). LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural
network (RNN) designed to capture long-term dependencies
in sequential data. LSTMs consist of memory cells, input
and forget gates, and output gates, allowing them to retain
information over long sequences and adapt to varying tem-
poral patterns. CNNs on the other hand, are deep learning
architectures designed for feature extraction from structured
data, such as images or time-series signals. CNNs consist of
convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected lay-
ers, enabling hierarchical feature learning and pattern recog-
nition. CNNs are applied to sensor data for fault detection,
anomaly detection, and condition monitoring, leveraging their
ability to automatically learn relevant features from raw data.
LSTMs have been successfully applied to time-series data for
equipment health monitoring, remaining useful life estimation,
and fault diagnosis. CNNs have been applied to sensor data for
fault detection, anomaly detection, and condition monitoring,
leveraging their ability to automatically learn relevant features
from raw data. However, these methods are purely data-driven
and do not incorporate the physics underlying the data.
D. Our Contributions:
We consider the C-MAPSS dataset as the main data for
this paper. As we have seen, this is a well-studied dataset, and
much work exists in the literature that address RUL prediction
on C-MAPSS data with classical and data-driven (deep) ML
methods. Our PIML based approach is different from previous
methods, and we use the data to rst learn the physics. In the
absence of published empirical physical laws governing the C-
MAPSS data, our approach rst uses stochastic PIML methods
to estimate the governing stochastic physics models from the
noisy time series data (this is referred to as the ﬁdiscoveryﬂ
mode of PIML). In this phase, we model the sensor data as
being governed by a system of rst order stochastic differential
equation (SDE) and estimate the mean and variance functions.
When the underlying statistical distribution at a given timestep
is known to be unimodal, we can use the sample mean and
variance as estimates of the mean and variance functions at
that timestep, or equivalently, the estimate of the
K
= 1

mean
cluster median and variance. If the distribution is multimodal
(with
K

modes) we use
K
-means clustering estimation to
dene the estimated mean and variance functions at the
timestep as the
K

medians of the collection of sample paths
at the timestep in question. We are thereby able to obtain
a surrogate for the underlying physics.
K
-means estimation
is a well-established nonparametric method, and using it, we
are able to model multi-modal sensor output wherein the
statistical distribution of the same sensor output is a multi-
modal distribution (see Figure 1b and Figure 2b). We then

use existing ML models (LSTM) with the learned physics to
generate predictions of RUL (the ﬁsolutionﬂ mode of PIML).
Unlike traditional PIML methods, in the solution mode, we
directly incorporate the mean and variance functions as data
augmentation rather than indirectly through a loss function.
The proposed set of methods delivers reliable, robust solutions
to the challenging problems of physics discovery and physics
informed prediction, relying on the superior generalization
capabilities of modern deep machine learning. Our results
indicate that PIML discovery and solutions methods are well
suited for this problem and outperform previous data-only deep
learning methods for this data set and task. Moreover, the
framework developed herein is exible, and can be adapted to
other situations (other sensor modalities or combined multi-
physics environments), including cases where the underlying
physics is only partially observed or known.

We now describe our physics model for the different
datasets. Recall the absence of existing physics based models
for the data. We therefore appeal to the approach of
learning
the physics from the raw data. To this end, we model the
output
S
(
t
)
of each (viable, information bearing) sensor via a
stochastic differential equation (SDE). Note that, inspecting
the sample paths of the sensors from FD001-FD004 (see
section III for more details on the dataset) shows that this
is a reasonable modeling choice. Indeed, several sensors are
well-modeled as geometric brownian motion. We assume the
following form for each sensor output
S
:
dS
(
t
) =
a
(
t
)
dt
+
b
(
t
)
dW
(

;
(1)
where
W
(
t
)
is a one-dimensional martingale stochastic pro-
cess (not necessarily Gaussian, but with independent incre-
ments) and
a
(
t
)
; b
(
t
)
are the
drift and diffusion
coefcients
respectively. The stochastic integrals are assumed to be in
the sense of Ito. Since
S
(
t
)
is a stochastic process, we will,
as needed, explicitly denote the dependence on a random
outcome in the event space
!
as
S
(
t; !
)
. In reality, the drift
and diffusion functions are themselves dependent on both
t
as well as
S
(
t
)
;
i.e.,
a
(
t
) = ~
a
(
t; S
(
t
))
and
b
(
t
) =
~
b
(
t; S
(
t
))
,
although for our purposes, we shall denote them as functions
of
t
alone, with the dependence on
S
(
t
)
being implicit. Thus,
each data set consists of multiple cycles of several sensor
values,

One possible approach would
be to estimate the corresponding
a
i

from the data
directly to fully specied the SDE model. However, we take a
slightly different approach. We instead estimate the mean and
variance process dened by:

S
(

These are the instantaneous mean and variance functions of
S
(

. Note that if

cess

i.e.,

p

we have that

(

and
ˆ
(

We take
this approach for the following reasons. First, an inspection
of sensor data as a function of time (over multiple cycles)
indicates that several sensors have non-Gaussian distribution
at different time instances (see for e.g. Figure 1b). Typical
use cases of the standard diffusive Ito SDE assume Gaussian,
independent increment processes, which would not be valid in
the current case. Second, estimating the coefcients
a
(
t
)
; b
(
t
)
directly from data would need further assumptions on the
underlying process
S
(
t
)
;
which, again, may not be valid.
Instead, we stay with the most general assumptions possible,
and estimate the mean and variance functions instead. Here,
the only assumption being made is that the process has nite
rst and second moments, which is evidently true.

We now discuss the estimation of

(

; ˆ
(

. We rst assume
that the distribution of
S

is unimodal for all

. This is
true for several sensors in the dataset. For a given sample path

we dene the support of the path as

to be the maximum length
of the vector of any sensor's readings over all cycles. If a given

ends before
T

is obtained by collecting the sample

and evaluating them at

thereby resulting
in the random variable

We then dene

be the mean and variance of the random variable

Finally, we can dene the estimates of the drift and diffusion
functions via an interpolation operator

Indeed, we preprocess
the sensor data and compute the drift and diffusion functions
using an appropriately dened histogram (or density estimate)
of the random variable

Computing
^

i

is done using
K

means clustering. Indeed,
since we know the distribution is unimodal, we compute the
single centroid of the distribution of
~
S
i
(


)
and dene it to
be the mean
^

i
(

)
. This way, we avoid explicit computation
of the expectation.
1) Estimating

(

)
; ˆ
(

)
: Multimodal Case:
Thus far, we
have tacitly assumed that the histogram (density estimate) of
~
S
i
(
k ; !
)
is unimodal when computing the drift and diffusion
functions. In some cases, this is not true, and we need to
modify our approach to include multi-modal densities. In
such cases, we resort to modeling the multi-modal density of
~
S
i
(
k ; !
)
using a
K

means estimate of the mean. Typically,
there are not more than two components in the mixure.
Accordingly, the same approach as earlier can be carried
forward (using
K
= 2
), with the caveat that we now have two
mean function estimates
^

(

)
(resp.

). The
particular sensors that exhibit this behavior can be ascertained
beforehand, and this multi-modal analysis can be done only
in such cases.
B. Generative Modeling: Synthetic Data Generation
Note that the above approach also yields a
generative
model for information-bearning sensors as well. Indeed, in
the standard diffusive SDE case, assuming that
W
(
t
)
is a
Brownian motion, we know from standard SDE theory that
the density
p
(
x; t
)
of
S
(

)
is a solution of the Fokker-Planck
equation:
@

Fig. 2: (Evolution of the histogram over time for the same

In our current case, we do not have such a clear mathematical
form for the evolution of the density. However, we can
sample from the
K
-means density estimate that we used to
compute the mean process at each time instant
t
k


to obtain generated sample paths. This is a unique feature
of our approach, and yields a physics-informed synthetic
data generation mechanism that can be used to augment the
raw (real) sensor data. Figures 3a and 3b show how we
can generate samples from the time-varying densities which
may possibly be multi-modal. The samples that are generated
evidently have similar mean/variance properties as the ﬁrealﬂ
data. Notice that, since

A. Dataset
We focus our experiments on the aforementioned C-MAPSS
dataset produced by NASA, which is organized into four
subsets corresponding to distinct aircraft operating conditions.
Each subset contains synthetic sensor readings meant to
simulate run-to-failure trajectories of turbofan engines. Each
trajectory is usually a few hundred timesteps. We drop 8 of
the 22 available sensors (sensors 1, 5, 6, 10, 16, 18, 19, and
22) and split each trajectory into 20-timestep windows, which
are shufed during training.
B. Deep Learning Model
Consistent with previous work [23], we use a small LSTM
neural network to predict the RUL at the end of each 20-
timestep window. Specically, we use a single-layer LSTM
with 12 hidden units and apply a two-layer MLP to the
LSTM's hidden state after all 20 timesteps have been pro-
cessed.
We train on each of the four operating conditions in isola-
tion, which aligns with real-world applications. We train the
model to minimize mean squared error (MSE) of the RUL at
the end of each 20-timestep window:

is ground truth. During testing,
we predict the RUL at the end of each trajectory in the test set
and report MSE across the entire test set (same as Equation 8)
along with the average L1 error. We report the average of these
metrics across 3 random seeds.
We use an Adam optimizer and a learning rate of 0.001.
We train the model for 100 epochs on the FD001 and FD003
subsets and for 1000 epochs o n the FD002 and FD004 subsets.
We also used early stopping, testing the best-performing model
from any epoch.
C. Results
Table I presents the MSE and L1 error of the model under
each operating condition. The leftmost columns indicate the
operating condition and whether

and/or
ˆ
were included as
input during each training run.
Under all four operating conditions, including

and
ˆ
signicantly outperforms the models where neither

or
ˆ
are
included.
ˆ
, however, appears to contain less information than

, as shown by our
ˆ
-only ablations; these runs nonetheless
outperformed the baseline under all operating conditions.
FD002 and FD004 are clearly of much greater complexity
than FD001 and FD003, which is consistent with previous
work [23].

We have presented a physics informed machine learning
(PIML) approach to solving the problem of remaining useful
lifetime (RUL) prediction using the C-MAPSS dataset. Our
approach, based on stochastic models of the underlying data, is
novel in that we do not use the traditional PIML architectures
such as PINNs, but rather augment the training data using
estimated underlying quantities. Finally, our apprach was
shown to allow for generative synthesis of data (i.e. physics
aware synthetic data generation). The statistical distribution
of the sensor data was seen to exhibit multi-modal behavior,
and our approach is valid in this situation as well. Our
experiments clearly indicate the increased accuracy (measured
both using MSE and absolute error) over traditional deep
learning (LSTM) approaches. It is expected that future work
in this area would involve increasing the scale and scope of
physics informed ML methods for predictive diagnostics.
