Abstract
We use a metho dology based on a machine learning algorithm to quantify rms'
cyb er risks based on their disclosures and a dedicated c yb er corpus. The mo del can
identify paragraphs related to determined cyb er-threat typ es and accordingly attribute
several related cyb er s cores to the rm. The cyb er scores are unrelated to other rms'
characteristics. Sto cks with high cyb er scores signicantly outp erform other s to cks.
The long-short cyb er risk factors have p ositive risk premia, are robust to all factors'
b enchmarks, and help price returns. Furthermore, we s ugge st the market do es not
distinguish b etween dierent typ es of cyb er risks but instead views them as a single,
aggregate cyb er risk.

1. Intro duction
Cyb er-insurance contracts and cyb ersecurity solutions have b ecome crucial for private
and public organizations in the widespread and costly context of cyb er incidents. These
countermeasures, however, have costs that are challenging to estimate. This pap er aims to
overcome this challenge us ing natural language pro cessing, clustering metho ds, and state-of-
the-art asset pricing techniques to disentangle and quantify the risk premia of various cyb er
threats.
The main fo cus of this pap er is to disentangle the dierent cyb er ris ks faced by rms
and the eects on exp ected returns through risk premia channels. To do this, we collect
nancial llings, monthly returns, and other rm characteristics for over 7000 rms listed on
US sto ck markets b etween January 2007 and Decemb er 2023. We use a neural network called
\Paragraph Vector" in combination with the MITRE ATT&CK cyb ersecurity knowledgebase
and clustering techniques to score each rm's ling based on its various typ es of cyb er risk.
We identify four typ es of cyb er attacks that emerge from the textual cluster structures of
MITRE ATT&CK. We establish scores to quantify the similarity b etween the annual state-
ments of rms, the 10-Ks, and the identied typ es of cyb er attacks from the knowledgebase
MITRE ATT&CK. We nd that the four cyb er scores present no correlation with standard
rms' characteristics known to help price sto ck returns and weak correlations with textual
non-semantic variables of the annual statement (the highest, 0
:
36, correlates with the length
of section 1.A., in the 10-Ks). As previously observed in Celeny and Marechal (2023), who
use the same neural network, the resulting aggregation of the various cyb er scores shows
increasing trends, with scores increasing by 0
:
04 from 2007 to 2023. Also, sp ecic industries
from the Fama-French 12-industries classication display higher cyb er scores, with Business
Equipment and Telephone and Televis ion Transmission b eing the highest.
Sorting rms into cyb er scores-based p ortfolios, we observe monotonically increasing
average excess returns along the sorts. All average excess returns of all p ortfolios are sta-
tistically signicant at the 1% level, and investing in a p ortfolio that enters a long (short)
p osition in the top (b ottom) cyb er scores rm is statistically signicant at the 5% level.
After controlling for common risk factors, the aforementioned results remain valid at the 5%
and 10% levels in the top p ortfolios.
The risk premia asso ciated with the dierent typ es of cyb er risk are also manifest at the
1
5% level in the cross-section with Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions. Using additional
pricing factors related to cyb er-based p ortfolios improves pricing ability. We demonstrate
that joint alphas of various assets tend to decrease in Gibb ons, Ross, and Shanken (1989)
tests. Using the Bayesian approach of Barillas and Shanken (2018), we also show that the
optimal subset of factors pricing sto ck returns invariably includes the cyb er-based factors.
Additional tests reveal that, although various typ es of cyb er risk exist, the market do es
not dierentiate b etween them and p erceives them as a s ingle aggregate cyb er risk. Finally,
we conduct an event study to evaluate the p erformance of a cyb er-based p ortfolio during
the massive SolarWinds cyb er attack in Decemb er 2020. Contrary to previous studies , in
particular, Florackis, Louca, Michaely, and Web er (2023), no signicant conclusions can
b e drawn from this event regarding the p erformance of our cyb er-based p ortfolios around
cyb erattacks.
The remainder of this work pro ceeds as follows. Section 2 intro duces the related literature
and develops hyp othes es . Section 3 details the data and the metho dology, Section 5 the
results, and Section 6 concludes.
2. Literature review
2.1. Sentiment analysis and text classication
This s tudy connects to several strands of the literature on s entiment analysis and its
application to nancial markets. First, it relates to the growing b o dy of research that uses
textual data to extract economic insights from corp orate lings and other nancial disclo-
sures (
e.g.
, Antweiler and Frank, 2004; Garcia, 2013; Arslan-Ayaydin, Boudt, and Thewissen,
2016). Early studies, such as Feldman, Govindara j, Livnat, and Segal (2010), examine the
Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) sections of 10-Q and 10-K lings and demon-
strated that changes in the tone of non-nancial information|measured by the frequency
of p ositive and negative words|correlate with b oth short-term market returns and longer-
term excess returns. This study highlighted the imp ortance of textual sentiment in SEC
lings, laying the groundwork for more nuanced measures of market sentiment. Similarly,
Jegadeesh and Wu (2013) intro duce a return-based term weighting scheme for measuring
do cument tone in 10-K lings. They demonstrate that the tone of thes e do cuments, es-
2
p ecially when weighted using p ositive and negative dictionaries, eectively predicts market
reactions around ling dates. Their metho d also generalizes well to other nancial do cu-
ments, such as IPO prosp ectuses, further expanding the applicability of sentiment analysis
in nancial contexts.
Building on these foundational studies, Antweiler and Frank (2004) apply sentiment anal-
ysis to online forums, showing how sentiment derived from nancial discussions could predict
market returns and trading volumes. Garcia (2013) extend the scop e of sentiment analysis
to nancial news, revealing that the predictive p ower of sentiment on sto ck returns is partic-
ularly pronounced during recessions. These studies collectively show that textual sentiment,
whether derived from nancial disclosures or public discourse, is critical in anticipating mar-
ket b ehavior. Furthermore, Bo dnaruk, Loughran, and McDonald (2015) advance textual
analysis by developing a linguis tic measure of rm-level nancial constraints based on 10-K
disclosures. Their approach, which identies constraining words such as \required" or \obli-
gations", proved more eective than traditional nancial constraint indexes in predicting
liquidity events, oering an innovative way to assess nancial health through text.
This study contributes to the literature on textual analysis to assess sp ecic risks. Hassan,
Hollander,
v an
Lent, and Tahoun (2019) and Sautner,
v an
Lent, Vilkov, and Zhang (2023)
apply sentiment analysis to earnings conference calls to measure rm-level p olitical risk and
climate risk, resp ectively. Hassan et al. (2019) use p olitical language to measure p olitical risk,
showing that p olitical discussions during earnings calls signicantly inuence rm b ehavior
and sto ck volatility. In contrast, Sautner et al. (2023) fo cus on climate-related language,
using a keyword discovery algorithm to assess the extent of rms' climate risk exp osure.
These studies demonstrate how sentiment analysis can b e tailored to identify sp ecic typ es
of risks b eyond traditional nancial metrics, thus expanding the scop e of risk analysis to
include so cio-p olitical and environmental factors.
Further extending the application of sentiment analysis, Calomiris and Mamaysky (2019)
incorp orate advanced text-pro cessing techniques, such as word ow measures, to predict
market returns and risks across b oth develop ed and emerging markets. Analyzing sentiment,
frequency, and entropy, they demonstrate that textual data could capture latent market risks
more eectively than traditional metho ds. This approach complements the earlier work of
Jegadeesh and Wu (2013) and Bo dnaruk et al. (2015) by showing how textual measures
can b e ne-tuned to assess not just sentiment but also nancial constraints and sp ecic risk
3
factors, such as market volatility or liquidity challenges.
This study ties into the broader literature on how textual sentiment inuences rm and
market b ehavior. Antweiler and Frank (2004) show that sentiment derived from public
discussions could aect sto ck prices and trading volumes. Arslan-Ayaydin et al. (2016)
demonstrate how managerial incentives shap e the tone of earnings press releases, inuencing
market reactions.
2.1.1. Vector representation of paragraphs and topics clustering
Our study also connects to several key advancements in the application of vector rep-
resentations and topic clustering for analyzing textual data. First, it relates to developing
distributed representations of paragraphs, most notably the Paragraph Vector (do c2vec)
mo del intro duced by Le and Mikolov (2014). do c2vec extends the word vector framework
to sentences, paragraphs, and entire do cuments by capturing semantic meanings in xed-
length vectors through neural network training. This technique allows for a richer, more
context-aware text representation, outp erforming traditional bag-of-words mo dels. How-
ever, its p erformance is highly sensitive to various hyp erparameters and data congurations,
as shown by Lau and Baldwin (2016). Their empirical evaluation of do c2vec provides critical
insights into optimizing the mo del for eective real-world use, emphasizing the imp ortance
of careful tuning when applying this metho d to dierent datasets.
Adosoglou, Lombardo, and Pardalos (2021) use do c2vec to analyze a vast corpus of
10-K lings from 1998 to 2018. They compare do c2vec with traditional dictionary-based
approaches and found that vector representations captured subtle semantic shifts in nancial
disclosures that were predictive of future abnormal returns. Sp ecically, they develop the
Semantic Similarity Portfolio (SSP) strategy, which identied rms with minimal year-on-
year semantic changes in their lings|particularly those with high cosine similarity scores
(
>

:
95) as strong candidates for achieving signicant future risk-adjusted returns, up to
10% annually. While their approach showcased the p otential of do c2vec in nancial text
analysis, it also underscored limitations, such as the computational cost of training mo dels
and the need to account for executive turnover that might inuence do cument language.
Regarding topic clustering, recent studies have extended the utility of vector-based repre-
sentations. Calomiris and Mamaysky (2019) apply unsup ervised clustering techniques, such
as the Louvain metho d, to group do cuments by topics and assess their relevance in predicting
4
market outcomes. They create a network of do cument similarities by constructing vectors of
word o ccurrences for each do cument and calculating s imilarity scores. The Louvain metho d
was then employed to detect sub-networks or clusters, which they dened as topics. This
clustering approach allowed them to identify signicant thematic structures in large corp ora
of news articles. Such clustered topics could provide valuable insights into future market
b ehavior, esp ecially in capturing collective sentiment shifts.
Further reinforcing the b enets of vector-based metho ds, Curiskis , Drake, Osb orn, and
Kennedy (2020) compare various do cument clustering and topic mo deling techniques using
so cial media text data. Their ndings underscored the eectiveness of do cument and word
emb eddings, particularly do c2vec, for do cument clustering tasks. By outp erforming tradi-
tional \tf-idf " based approaches and other topic mo deling techniques, do c2vec emb eddings,
combined with k-means clustering, yielded sup erior results across dierent datasets. They
observe that do c2vec emb eddings p erformed consistently well regardless of do cument length,
although optimal training ep o ch requirements varied with do cument size. These results sug-
gest that do c2vec is a robust and adaptable to ol for clustering tasks across various text
lengths and typ es.
2.2. Cyber risk and expected stock returns
Finally, our study builds on a growing b o dy of literature that examines the intersection of
cyb ersecurity risk and asset pricing. Jamilov, Rey, and Tahoun (2023) develop a dictionary-
based measure of cyb er risk exp osure using quarterly earnings calls from over 13,000 rms
in 85 countries from 2002 to 2021. Their dictionary of cyb er-related terms was validated
by demonstrating predictability for future cyb erattacks and correlations with sto ck market
outcomes and realized volatility. Imp ortantly, the study shows that cyb er risk measures can
forecast cyb erattacks in subsequent quarters and do cument geographical patterns in cyb er
risk exp osure. The ndings are signicant for global investors, as U.S. equity holdings in
foreign countries predict the destination countries' cyb er exp osure. Additionally, the authors
explore the pricing of cyb er risk in the options market, showing that rms with higher cyb er
risk exp osure face higher costs for market-based protection against price and variance risks.
These results s uggest that cyb er risk has real economic implications and is increasingly
integrated into sto ck market exp ectations.
5
Florackis et al. (2023) present a cyb ersecurity risk measure based on textual analysis of
the \Item 1. A. Risk Factors" section of 10-K lings from 2007 to 2018. By comparing these
risk factors acros s rms using cosine similarity measures, they eectively identify companies
with signicant cyb ersecurity risk exp osure. The measure correlates with various rm char-
acteristics, such as size, growth opp ortunities , and R&D exp enditures, and predicts future
cyb erattacks. Furthermore, the authors show that p ortfolios comp os ed of rms with high
cyb ersecurity risk scores earn a signicant return premium of up to 8.3% annually. This risk
premium is robust across dierent sp ecications, conrming that investors require comp en-
sation for holding sto cks exp osed to cyb ersecurity risks. The study als o demonstrates that
the cyb ersecurity-based p ortfolio underp erforms during p erio ds of heightened investor at-
tention to cyb ersecurity but delivers high returns during other times, suggesting an element
of market underreaction to latent cyb er risks.
Taking a dierent approach, Celeny and Marechal (2023) intro duce a metho d for esti-
mating cyb er risk using do c2vec trained on the MITRE ATT&CK cyb ersecurity knowledge
base and applied it to 10-K statements. Unlike the dictionary-based approaches, their mo del
captures broader contextual information from the entire do cument, resulting in a more com-
prehensive and accurate cyb er risk score. They show that p ortfolios sorted by their cyb er
risk score achieve substantial excess returns|up to 18.72% annually with a signicant risk
premium of 6.93% on a long-short p ortfolio. Their analysis highlights the critical role of cy-
b er risk in the cross-section of sto ck returns, and their do c2vec-based approach outp erforms
traditional dictionary-based metho ds, such as the one develop ed by Florackis et al. (2023).
The study's robustness tests further validate the metho d, showing that the cyb er risk factor
remains consistent over time and is not inuenced by the exclusion of cyb ersecurity rms,
oering a more accurate measure of latent cyb er risk exp osure.
Additionally, Liu, Marsh, and Xiao (2022) explore how rms' sensitivity to cyb ercrime
impacts the pricing of individual sto cks and equity p ortfolios. Using a news-based cyb ercrime
index and corrob orating their ndings with Go ogle search trends, the authors demonstrate a
signicant negative correlation b etween cyb ercrime exp osure and subsequent s to ck returns.
Their study shows that rms with higher sensitivity to cyb ercrime tend to underp erform
in the market, and they further highlight how corp orate governance, IT investments , and
industry dynamics shap e rms' vulnerability to cyb er threats. Moreover, they nd that high
cyb ercrime b eta sto cks consistently outp erform their low-b eta counterparts, particularly fol-
6
lowing signicant cyb er incidents. These ndings emphasize the imp ortance of incorp orating
cyb ercrime exp osure into asset pricing mo dels. Jiang, Khanna, Yang, and Zhou (2023) use a
cyb er dictionary from NIST to count the numb er of cyb er-related words in Item 1. A. Com-
bining it with rm characteristics, they p erform a logit ridge regression where the dep endent
variable is the probability for a rm to exp erience a cyb erattack in the future.
Lastly, Gomes, Mihet, and Risbabh (2023) examine how cyb er risk drives rm-level
innovation, esp ecially in rms that develop cyb ersecurity measures internally. Using the
cyb er risk score from Florackis et al. (2023) alongside patent data shows that rms heavily
exp osed to cyb er risk are incentivized to innovate in cyb ersecurity solutions, which can
contribute to long-term growth.
3. Data and metho dology
3.1. Market data
We download public equity data from Wharton Research Data Services
1
(WRDS), and their
API. The data originated from the Center for Research in Security Prices
2
(CRSP) and S&P
Global Market Intelligence's Compustat database
3
. We rep ort the lis t of variables in Table
A1 and Table 1 rep ort their statistics after cleaning.
We use a pre-existing Python script that retrieves all available data from WRDS ab out
various rms and lters out those that have not led 10-K forms with the SEC. We extract
monthly sto ck returns and nancial ratios for 7,079 rms b etween January 2007 and De-
cemb er 2023. We depict the industry distribution of these rms using the Fama-French 12
industry distribution in Figure 1.
We also download the one-month Treasury bill rate and returns on the market, b o ok-
to-market (HML), size (SMB), momentum (UMD), investment (CMA), and op erating prof-
itability (RMW) factors from the Kenneth French data rep ository

3.2. 10-K statements
10-K statements are nancial lings publicly traded companies submit annually to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commis sion (SEC). They contain information such as companies'
nancial statements, risk factors, and executive comp ensation. 10-K statements will later b e
used to build a cyb ersecurity risk measure. The index les from the SEC's Edgar archives
5
are used to download and structure the 10-K. These index les contain information ab out all
the do cuments led by all rms for a sp ecic quarter. Each line of the index le corresp onds
to a 10-K and is structured as follows:
CIK|Company Name|Form Typ e|Date Filed|Filename
Where Filename is the U RL under which an HTML version of the do cument is available.
Their Central Index Key (CIK) is used to identify rms. The CIK consists of a numb er
used by the SEC to identify corp orations and individuals who have led disclosures. We
use a Python script that go es through these index les and identies URLs corresp onding
to 10-K statements using the Form Typ e entry. These U RLs are matched to one of the
7,079 rms using the CIK entry. 64,988 10-K statements are identied, corresp onding to
2.73 statements p er rm on average. The evolution of the numb er of 10-K lled annually is
rep orted in Figure 2.

3.3. MITRE ATT&CK description
The MITRE ATT&CK
6
cyb ersecurity knowledge base is used as a reference for cyb er
attack descriptions. This knowledge base was created in 2013 to do cument cyb er attack tac-
tics, techniques, and pro cedures. It is structured by tactics, techniques, and sub-techniques
as depicted in Figure 3. There are 14 tactics: reconnaissance, resource development, initial
5

https://attack.mitre.org/
8
access, execution, p ersistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, discov-
ery, lateral movement, collection, command and control, exltration, and impact. There are
785 sub-techniques across all tactics. Two examples of sub-techniques are given in Table 2.
[Insert Figure 3 here]
[Insert Table 2 here]
Figure 3 and Table 2 are taken from Celeny and Marechal (2023). The Data section closely
follows their approach, and much of their co de has b een repurp osed to suit our requirements.
The additional data primarily originates from 2023.
3.4. Cyber score
To compute the cyb er scores of interest, We start with the 14 individual MITRE ATT&CK
tactics: Reconnaissance, Resource, Development, Initial Access Execution, Persistence, Priv-
ilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential, Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Col-
lection, Command and Control, Exltration, Impact. To reduce this dimensionality, We
aggregate them with clustering metho ds (see 3.4.4) that yield the following \sup ertactics":
Command and data manipulation, Credential movement, Persistence and evasion, Prepa-
ration and reconnaissance. For comparison, we also add the overall score, aggregating all
14 categories into one, corresp onding to the score obtained in Celeny and Marechal (2023).
Finally, We add a variation of the overall score that relates b etter to the risk notion: the
cyb er sentiment score.
3.4.1. Preprocessing
Everything related to text pro cessing and its use is done exactly as des crib ed in Celeny
and Marechal (2023). We download 10-K statements from the SEC Archives as HTML les.
Then, we use the library BeautifulSoup to extract usable texts from HTML.
7
We remove
punctuation and numb ers and set all letters to lowercase. Finally, we apply the Python
script of Celeny and Marechal (2023) that uses the \wordfreq" and NLTK libraries to divide
7
https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
9
the text into sentences, remove stop-words such as \the", \is", \and", . . . ) and remove the
most common words.
8 9
After pre-pro cessing, the average length of the MITRE ATT&CK sub-technique descrip-
tions is 39.7 words. We use a Python algorithm to merge consecutive s entences from 10-K
statements into paragraphs with an average length of close to 40 words after pre-pro cessing.
This results in an average of 640 paragraphs p er 10-K statement with 46 words p er para-
graph. The standard deviation is 2.8 words p er paragraph and 309 paragraphs p er 10-K
statement.
3.4.2. Paragraph Vector algorithm (doc2vec)
As in Celeny and Marechal (2023), we us e the paragraph to vector mo del prop osed
by Le and Mikolov (2014), which is an extension of the word2vec mo del (Mikolov, Chen,
Corrado, and Dean, 2013). There are various advantages to working with this NLP approach
compared to others, such as the dictionary approach. First, the comprehension of the metho d
is semantical, meaning that it is not limited to a count of word frequencies. The word
order impacts the resulting vector, and paragraphs with similar or synonym words will have
close vector representations. Second, training the mo del with sp ecic text that involves a
particular vo cabulary allows the incorp oration of relatively unknown words. Finally, the
resulting vectors have a dimension usually much smaller than vectors resulting from the
dictionary approach.
Two mo del versions exist: the distributed memory mo del (DM) and the distributed bag-
of-words mo del (DBOW). In the DM, a neural network is trained as follows. First, a word is
removed in a paragraph. Then, inputting the paragraph vector representation and context
words (also in vector representation) surrounding the missing word, the neural network is
optimized by trying to guess the missing word. In the DBOW, the neural network is trained
to predict a series of words sampled from a paragraph using only the vector representation
of the paragraph as input. Figure 4 illustrates the training pro cess of the two mo dels.

https://www.nltk.org/
10
The training data and details, the hyp erparameters and their validation, and the nal
mo del choice are extensively covered in Celeny and Marechal (2023). This work uses their
saved do c2vec mo del.
10
3.4.3. Cosine similarity
Using the do c2vec metho d previously describ ed, all paragraphs of interest can b e emb ed-
ded into vectors. A common way to attribute a similarity score to two paragraph vectors is
to take the cosine of the angle they form. Other ways exist, but only measuring the angle
was proven more eective than considering the vectors' magnitude (see Adosoglou et al.,
2021). This is b ecause the latter is more aected by the random initialization of weights
during training in the neural network that outputs the vectors.
3.4.4. Cyber tactics clustering
We disentangle the overall cyb er s core obtained in Celeny and Marechal (2023). The idea
is that the risk coming from dierent areas of cyb er security might not b e similarly priced
and, therefore, should not b e aggregated into a single score but rather b e separated into sub-
cyb er scores. A natural way of splitting the overall score into dierent categories comes from
the written structure of MI TRE ATT&CK, with 14 categories already mentioned in chapter
4.1. However, it is b elieved that splitting the overall score to such an extent might result in a
loss of explanatory p ower and highly correlated sub-cyb er scores. Therefore, aggregating the
14 tactics into a few sup er tactics might mitigate the negative eect of splitting the overall
score.
On the other hand, with the do c2vec metho d and the similarity score, we can transform
every 785 sub-techniques (paragraphs) of MITRE ATT&CK into vectors and compare their
similarity. This pro cess results in a similarity matrix of dimension 785 by 785, onto which
clustering metho ds can b e applied. Indeed, the similarity matrix can b e understo o d as the
representation of a network where every 785 no des (paragraphs) are connected by edge values
weighted by their similarity. In this context, we present three classical clustering metho ds.
The rst and most simplistic clustering metho d is K-Means. Note that since the input
similarity matrix is based on cosine similarity, it is rather designated as spherical K-Means,
10
https://github.com/technometrics- lab/17- Cyber- risk_and_the_cross- section_of_stock_
returns
11
where the distance b etween each p oint to class into K categories is understo o d as the angle
b etween the vectors dened by those p oints rather than the Euclidian distance b etween those
p oints. Either version of K-Means works as follows : It b egins by randomly setting initial
cluster centroids, then iteratively assigns each data p oint (paragraphs) to the nearest centroid
and up dates the centroids by recalculating their mean p ositions among their asso ciated
data p oints. The pro cess is rep eated until convergence. Note that although the K-Means
algorithm always converges, it is relatively dep endent on the initial centroid guess. The user
must cho ose the numb er of clusters K without prior knowledge. The algorithm generally
pro duces rough results but often reveals an initial simple structure in the similarity of the
provided data.
The second metho d is much more p owerful as it requires no prior hyp erparameters;
thus, the numb er of clusters is an output of the metho d. The Louvain metho d, explained
in Blondel, Guillaume, Lambiotte, and Lefebvre (2008), provides a straightforward way
to identify clusters (groups of no des within a graph that are more dens ely connected) in a
network. To explain the Louvain metho d, we rst need to intro duce the notion of mo dularity.
It is dened as a value in the [

1
=
2
;
1] range that measures the density of links within

signed to its own community. Then, the metho d iterates through two phases: the rst phase
optimizes mo dularity lo cally by moving individual no des b etween communities to maximize
the increase in mo dularity. The second phase aggregates the no des in each community in
the rst phase into single no des and builds a new network, where the communities found
in the rst phase are treated as no des. Phases one and two are rep eated until no further
improvement in mo dularity is p ossible. The nal partitioning of no des into communities is
returned as a result.

The third clustering metho d is spherical K-means on a dimens ionally reduced similarity
matrix. The sp ectral clustering metho d works as follows. First, the degree matrix
D
is
constructed. it consists in a diagonal matrix where each entry
D
ii
represents the sum of
similarities for no de
i
and is computed as
D
ii
=
P
j
S

. The Laplacian matrix
L
is dened
as
L
=
D

S
. The sp ectral clustering algorithm computes the eigenvectors and eigenvalues
of the Laplacian matrix
L
. Let


; 
2
; :::; 
N
b e the eigenvalues and
v
1
; v
2
; :::; v
N
b e the
corresp onding eigenvectors. After obtaining the eigenvectors, we select the
K
eigenvectors
corresp onding to the
K
smallest eigenvalues (excluding the smallest eigenvalue, typically
zero). We arrange these eigenvectors as columns in a matrix
V
of dimension K by N.
Finally, we clus ter the rows of the matrix
V
using the k-means clustering metho d. The
p ower of this approach is that we can cho ose the numb er of features necessary to p erform a
satisfying clustering (reducing from N=785 to K<20, for example, can radically improve the
clustering by getting rid of sup eruous dimensions).
Finally, scoring is needed to nd the b est clustering output pro duced by the wide range
of hyp erparameters and metho d choices. We prop ose a rather simple but ecient approach
that requires initial lab elalization of each no de. Each paragraph (no de) is a sub-technique
b elonging to one of the 14 tactics of MITRE ATT&CK. Thus, they naturally already b e-
long exclusively to 14 sub-clusters. The discrimination of clustering metho ds works on the
following two requirements .
First, we want the paragraphs b elonging to one tactic (sub-cluster) to b elong to the
same sup er-tactic,
i.e.
, the same cluster found by the metho d. Indeed, the paragraphs are
initially classed by the creator of MITRE ATT&CK together b ecause they share common
characteristics. It would not b e very sensible to spread them across dierent sup er-tactics
(clusters) once the clustering metho d is applied. Thus, a measure of sub-cluster heterogeneity
among clusters is needed. We use Shannon entropy, dened as follows:
H
sub
j
=

nb:cl uster s
X
i
=1
P
(
sub
j
)
i
log
P
(
sub
j
)
i
(1)
Where
P
(
sub
j
)
i
is the prop ortion of paragraphs of sub-cluster (tactic) j b elonging to cluster
(sup er tactic)
i
. Intuitively, if we are in an ideal case and the paragraphs of a sub-cluster
j
are
entirely contained in cluster 1 we would have
P
(
sub
j
)
1
= 1 and
P
(
sub
j
)
i
= 0 for
i
6
= 1, thus
leading to
H
sub
j
= 0 b eing minimal (mind the minus sign in the equation and the logarithm
13
on numb er lower than 1). If we start to spread the paragraph of the sub-cluster among
other clusters, the
P
(
sub
j
)
i
b ecomes dierent from 0 and 1, and
H
sub
j
gradually increases.
To reduce the 14
H
sub
j
to one score of discrimination, we sum them all, thus obtaining the
Entropy sum, the sub-cluster heterogeneity measure among clusters. The heterogeneity is
high when the Entropy sum is low.
Second, we need a score to counter the following extreme case. All sub-clusters, but one
may b e classed into one cluster and the last sub-cluster into a second cluster. This would
lead to a minimum Entropy sum of 0 but would have no value for our application. We want
the sub-cluster to b e reasonably spread out among the clusters. To translate this idea into
a meaningful score, we create a Balanced score, dened as the standard deviation of the
lab el counts. In other words, the clustering metho d pro duced an ordered list of 785 values
corresp onding to the lab el of the cluster each paragraph b elongs to. For each lab el, we
count the numb er of o ccurrences on the list. If the paragraphs are relatively well spread out
across the cluster, then taking the standard deviation of all the count of the lab els should
b e low since each cluster would contain approximately the same numb er of paragraphs. The
last case to worry ab out is that the balanced score could b e low, but the paragraph would
b e randomly spread across the cluster, thus not reecting the initial structure of MITRE
ATT&CK tactics (sub-clusters). To counter that, it is sucient to consider the Entropy
sum.
Considering the metho d that outputs the lowest Entropy sum and the lowest balanced
score, we discriminate the dierent clustering metho ds' outputs. Note that there is no
guideline regarding the optimal trade-o b etween the two scores,
i.e.
what additional amount
is optimal to forfeit to the Entropy sum to lower the Balanced score and inversely.
Finally, the whole clustering pro cess describ ed here must b e seen more as a guideline
to ol. Indeed, after cho osing the b est metho d, we class each paragraph in the cluster where
most of its sub-cluster b elongs, regardless of the metho d's output for the misplaced para-
graphs. The s tructure of MITRE ATT&CK is probably more coherent than the output of
any unsup ervised clustering metho d. However, it is still advantageous to consider the new
clustering structure output since it is based on the cosine similarity matrix, and it could
maximize the likeliho o d of reducing the correlation b etween the dierent sub-cyb er scores
that will also b e based on cosine similarities.
14
3.4.5. Setting the cyber score
At this p oint, each paragraph of a 10-K can b e transformed into a vector, and the same
can b e done with the 785 paragraphs of MITRE ATT&CK. Then, each paragraph of the 10-
K can b e compared to each paragraph of MITRE ATT&CK. This leads to each paragraph of
the 10-K b eing asso ciated with 785 cosine similarities. Celeny and Marechal (2023) computes
the cyb er score of a 10-K by asso ciating the maximum out of the 785 cosine similarities to
each paragraph and then taking the average of the top 99% of these maxima.
Similarly, we dene a sub-cyb er score by asso ciating to each paragraph the cosine s imi-
larities of a subset of paragraphs of MITRE ATT&CK . For example, each paragraph would
b e asso ciated with 120 cosine similarities (instead of 785), where 120 would corresp ond to
the 120 paragraphs of MITRE ATT&CK that b elong to the same category (cluster or sub-
cluster/ sup er tactic or tactic). Then, nding the sub-cyb er score asso ciated with a sup er
tactic or tactic would b e the same as describ ed in the previous paragraph; we take the max-
imum out of the 120 cosine similarities for each paragraph and then compute the average of
the top 99% of these maxima.
3.4.6. Sentiment analysis
To establish a cyb er sentiment score, we opt for a straightforward approach. We dene
the cyb er score as it was done in Celeny and Marechal (2023), but instead of taking the
maximum, we take 0 if the paragraph do es not contain a word from a sp ecic list and the
maximum as usual if it do es contain a word from the sp ecic lis t.
The sp ecic list is dened in Hassan et al. (2019) and is rep orted in the annex. It
contains words relative to \risk" or \uncertainty" and was created using the Oxford English
Dictionary.
3.5. Asset pricing tests
3.5.1. Univariate sorts
Five p ortfolios are constructed based on a cyb er score of interest. Firms are classied
each quarter based on their most recent known cyb er score from the previous quarter. These
rms are then divided into ve categories corresp onding to the quintiles of their cyb er scores.
15
Consequently, the rms in the top 20% of cyb er scores are placed in Portfolio 5 (P5). After
that, each rm is weighted within its p ortfolio according to its market capitalization known
from the end of the previous quarter. The cyb er-based p ortfolios are up dated quarterly.
A rst quantitative test consists of observing whether the average returns of each p ortfolio
change monotonically with the increasing cyb er score. The idea is to see if returns are aected
by this cyb er classication, thus hinting at a p otential cyb er-related risk structure.
Next, we assess p ortfolios' returns, controlling for pricing factors , by using pricing factors
recognized in the literature (factors included in the CAPM, in Fama and French, 1992 (FFC)
and in Fama and French, 2015 (FF5)), we observe if their linear combinations are sucient
to explain the returns of the p ortfolio or if statistically signicant alpha (intercept) app ear,
meaning that the protability of the p ortfolios based on cyb er score can not b e entirely
explained by common pricing factor and new ones are needed.
3.5.2. Double sorts
The interest in the double sorting metho d is the same as in univariate sorting. We want
to see if returns are aected by the cyb er classication. However, the cyb er score may
b e a proxy
i.e.
something that mimics another rm characteristic, such as the size, the
b o ok-to-market ratio, or market b eta. To avoid that, we sort the rms according to one
of the three characteristics mentioned. These rms are then divided into ve categories
corresp onding to the quintiles of their characteristic. Consequently, the rms in the top 20%
of the characteristic of interest (for example, rms with the highest b o ok-to-market ratio)
are placed in category 5 (Q5). Then, for the rm of each category Q1 to Q5, we construct a
p ortfolio based on a cyb er score as describ ed previously to obtain 25 p ortfolios, ve for each
category.
3.5.3. Cross-sectional tests
Fama and MacBeth (1973) prop oses the following metho d. First, estimate b etas using
time series regressions with 2-year rolling windows (24 months ). This corresp onds to the
following regression for each asset i with

(ranging from January 2009 to Decemb er 2023, in this example). Then,
we build twenty p ortfolios based on the cyb er score analogously to the ve cyb er score-based
p ortfolios describ ed earlier. Knowing the weight
x

through time, we compute the factor exp osures of the p ortfolios:

3.6. Time-series tests
Gibb ons et al. (1989) intro duces a statistical test to assess p ortfolio pricing eciency:
R

=

i

X
p

i;p
R
p;t
+

i;t
;
8
i;
(6)
where
R
i;t
and
R
p;t
are assets and p ortfolio returns, resp ectively. If the p ortfolios were
carefully selected, they could correctly predict the asset returns, thus suppressing the need
for alphas (intercepts that contain contributions to their as set returns not taken into account
17
by the explanatory p ortfolios). GRS provides a statistical test for this null hyp othesis:
H
0
:

i
= 0
8
i
. Co chrane (2005) generalize this idea by including traded factors
F
k
instead as
explanatory variables and p ortfolio excess returns as the endogenous one:
R
e
p;t

p

(7)
In that case, the GRS score that tests jointly the zero alphas follows a F-distribution:

b e p erformed four times on four series of 20 p ortfolios constructed according to the cyb er
score, the size, the b o ok-to-market ratio, and the market b eta of involved rms.
3.6.1. Bayesian approach
Barillas and Shanken (2018) intro duces three metho ds to test pricing factors. The rst
metho d is close to the GRS and commonly tests zero alpha for pricing factors and p ortfolio
returns. The second metho d tests, for a given set of factors, if a subset of those factors is
sucient to price p ortfolio returns. The third metho d, on which we fo cus here, allows us to
nd which subset of factors, among a large given set of factors, are the b est pricing factors.
It is a \relative" metho d, meaning that no returns are required for the test. To pro duce the
test, they rst intro duce the marginal likeliho o d asso ciated with a given subset of factors:
ML = M L

Where
f

f

are the factors excluded from the subs et (but in
the general set), and
M k t
is the market excess returns. Note that the third term can b e
ignored; it will later b e canceled out since it is common to any subset of factors. ML

4. Results
4.1. Clustering of MITRE ATT&CK
We apply the clustering metho ds on the cosine similarity matrix created from MITRE
ATT&CK paragraphs vector emb eddings. This allows for identifying the relevant sub-cyb er
score tied to previously mentioned sup er tactics (command and data manipulation, credential
movement, p ersistence and evasion, and preparation and reconnaissance). We rep ort the
results of various attempts with dierent clustering metho ds in Figures 5, 6, and 7. The
K-means metho ds provide a coherent but crude initial structure that we rep ort in Figure 5.
Indeed, the paragraphs tend to b e well spread across the sup er tactics (clusters) but at the
cost of heterogeneity, with the exclusivity of a tactic in a sup er tactic b eing inexistent. This
results in a low balanced score at the cost of entropy, as depicted in Figure 8.
Figure 6 shows the p erformance of the Louvain metho d. This metho d greatly improves
the heterogeneity, esp ecially with tactics 5 and 12 (resource development and reconnaissance)
exclusive to cluster 1 (the s up er tactic: preparation and reconnais sance). However, not
putting a threshold on the inputted similarity matrix comp onent induces the Louvain metho d
to create two sup eruous clusters. Hence, we include those restrictions. Indeed, when
comparing two paragraphs of MITRE ATT&CK, it is not uncommon to encounter sentences
with s imilar structures for dierent semantic content. Thus, we tone down the similarity
20
of a highly to o similar paragraph with a higher threshold. Conversely, we dene a lower
threshold such that similarities that are to o low and, therefore, most likely noise that reects
no similarity are set to zero.
The last metho d can b e seen as a safeguard for the output of the Louvain metho d.
Applying the sp ectral clustering metho d, we retrieve the structure previously encountered
with higher heterogeneity than with K-means. If the hyp erparameters are correctly tuned,
the output is similar to the Louvain metho d's, particularly for
n
= 4 and
eg n
= 6. We
rep ort the results in Figure 7. Including more dimensions (higher
eg n
value) adds noise and
decreases the clustering quality.
Finally, we select the output of the Louvain metho d as a baseline to group the tactics
without splitting them across sup er tactics. Although Figure 8 shows that outputs of other
metho ds may b e slightly b etter, we favor the Louvain metho d since no additional hyp erpa-
rameters tuning is required.
[Insert Figure 5 here]
[Insert Figure 6 here]
[Insert Figure 7 here]
[Insert Figure 8 here]
This yields the following cluster/sup er tactics. we name each of them after their content:
Preparation and Reconnaissance
: This sup er tactic encompasses adversaries' tactics
to prepare and gather information b efore launching an attack.
Impact
involves actions
that disrupt, destroy, or manipulate systems and data to achieve the attacker's ob jectives.
Initial Access
includes techniques adversaries use to gain an initial fo othold within a net-
work, such as exploiting vulnerabilities or sp ear phishing.
Resource Development
entails
the acquisition of resources like infrastructure, to ols, and credentials necessary to supp ort
op erations.
Reconnaissance
involves gathering information ab out the target environment
to identify p otential entry p oints and vulnerabilities.
Discovery
refers to techniques used
to explore and map the target environment, such as network scanning and enumeration.
21
Persistence and Evasion
: Once inside a target network, adversaries employ these
tactics to maintain their fo othold and avoid detection.
Persistence
ensures the attacker
can maintain access even if the system is reb o oted or credentials are changed by installing
malware or creating rogue accounts.
Privilege Escalation
involves gaining higher-level
p ermissions to access more sensitive information and critical systems.
Execution
refers
to running malicious co de on a victim system, often necessary to carry out the attacker's
ob jectives.
Defense Evasion
includes a variety of metho ds to avoid detection and thwart
defensive measures, such as disabling security software, obfuscating co de, or using leless
malware.
Credential Movement
: This group fo cuses on techniques used to s teal and use cre-
dentials to move within a network.
Credential Access
involves obtaining account names,
passwords, and other secrets that allow attackers to authenticate themselves as legitimate
users. Techniques include keylogging, credential dumping, and brute force attacks.
Lat-
eral Movement
is moving through a network to nd and access additional targets or more
valuable data. This can b e done using remote services, exploiting trust relationships, or
leveraging legitimate credentials to access other systems and resources.
Command and Data Manipulation
: In this phase, adversaries exert control over com-
promised systems and manipulate data to achieve their goals.
Command and Control
involves establishing a communication channel with the compromised environment to issue
commands and control malware. This can b e achieved through web trac, DNS, or custom
communication proto cols with command servers.
Collection
refers to gathering sensitive
information from compromised systems, such as capturing screenshots, logging keystrokes, or
accessing stored les.
Exltration
involves transferring the collected data from the target
network to an external lo cation controlled by the adversary, often using encrypted channels
or covert metho ds to avoid detection.

4.2. Cyber scores statistical descriptions
From the identied sup er tactics, we construct the cyb er scores from the 10-Ks of each
rm through the years. Table 3 presents the statistics related to each cyb er score (the 14
tactics of MITRE ATT&CK, the four sup er tactics, the overall score, and the cyb er sentiment
score). Although their distribution app ears similar, several facts must b e considered. First,
the statistics are for the whole sample, but the distribution is time-varying as Figures 9,
10, 11, and 12 suggest. This means that cyb er scores evolving at dierent rates could b e
misrepresented. Second, the cosine similarity implies, in theory, a distribution ranging from

1 to 1, whereas the s cores are much more narrowly distributed empirically. Thus, the slight
variation observed in Table 3 is more meaningful than simple noise.
Two additional asp ects must also b e rep orted. First, some tactics lose relevance in the 10-
Ks over time, and evidence of the cyb er scores reecting cyb er risk has yet to b e presented.
However, this rst feature is encouraging since the cyb er scores are evolving dierently,
showcasing a shift of cyb er-related information in the 10-Ks. Second, the cyb er sentiment
score has a higher 99 p ercentile than the other score, implying that taking out non-risk-
related scores eectively removes p oints previously b elonging to the top one p ercentile.

We present the correlation b etween cyb er scores at the rm level (non-aggregated) in
Figure 13. Unsurprisingly, the correlations b etween all scores are high, except for the senti-
ment score, which diers in its construction. This is exp ected since all scores come from the
same do c2vec neural network output.

4.3. Cyber scores and nancial characteristics
To ensure that the cyb er scores are innovative and not the combination of other existent
characteristics of the rm, we present the linear regression of the cyb er scores of interest in
Tables 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Compared to Celeny and Marechal (2023), we add the following
variables: readability, secret, risk length table, volume p er capital, and humans p er capital.
we describ e all variables in Table A1. The rst three variables were part of the tested
explanatory variables in Florackis et al. (2023). Including the risk length table shows the
critical improvement made with the cyb er score of this pap er. Indeed, Florackis et al. (2023)
rep ort t-statistics of 40
:
80 and 20
:
59 for mo dels 1 and 2, resp ectively. Those t-statistics are
signicantly lower, improving our score's indep endence with non-semantic variables.
We include a new explanatory variable in the mo dels with the following underlying idea:
If a limited numb er of employees are in a rm with highly valuable assets, those assets are
more likely to b e technological and could b e cyb er risky. This risk would then b e rep orted in
the 10-Ks and thus b e reected in the cyb er score. This choice proves relevant as the Tables
rep ort t-statistics close to 10 for all cyb er scores. The co ecient negative sign supp orts the
view that the lower the human capital ratio, the higher it should b e reected on the cyb er
score.
12
The statistical signicance of other co ecients do es not depart to o much from the pre-
vious studies, with most of the variables b eing statistically non-signicant or with the same
sign as in Celeny and Marechal (2023), esp ecially at the rm level. Note that, despite adding
new variables with higher t-statistics, the
R
2
within is still low. It shows that additional
variables cannot fully explain the dierent cyb er scores. Furthermore, dierent t-statistics
are obtained for each cyb er score for the same co ecient. This suggests that each score
could proxy for an intrinsically dierent risk for the rm.
Figure 14 displays the correlation of all cyb er scores with the mentioned variables. As
exp ected, variables with generally higher t-statistics tend to correlate more to the cyb er
scores. However, The correlation with \secret" must b e taken cautiously s ince it is a dummy
variable and the cyb er score is close to 0.5; the correlation may b e spurious or, at b est, not
informative.
12
Additionally, we compute the covariance and correlation of each cyb er score with the idiosyncratic
volatility of rms. The results are presented in App endix A2. We thank Prof. Julien Hugonnier for this
comment.
24
Figure 15 shows the average cyb er scores across industries. The overall score is always
higher than other scores when controlling for industry. This was already the case in Table 3.
The cyb er sentiment score displays much fewer dierences across industries when compared
to other scores. This suggests that the score do es not contain additional information or
even destroy some of it at the industry level. As mentioned in Celeny and Marechal (2023),
industries that rely more heavily on technology, like Business Equipment or Telephone and
Television Transmission, p otentially rep ort their cyb er risk and thus have higher cyb er scores.
One can also observe that the dierent cyb er scores vary dierently across the industry,
further highlighting the p otential changes in the source of cyb er risk disclosed in the 10-Ks.

4.4. Univariate sorts
This section answers the following questions: Do es a p ortfolio sorted according to a given
cyb er score display a structure in its returns? Are the pricing factors usually found in the
literature enough to fully explain (not generate alphas on) the return of the cyb er-based
p ortfolios?
Tables 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15 all display increasing average excess returns, along with the
asso ciated cyb er score, with P5 b eing the p ortfolio of rms with the highest cyb er score. If
a given cyb er score is an adequate proxy for the asso ciated cyb er risk, it implies that taking
25
additional cyb er risk grants additional returns. This idea is further explored in the next
section.
In Table 11, we rep ort the average returns of p ortfolios sorted on the cyb er sentiment
score. Despite all returns b eing statistically signicant at the 1% level, we cannot observe a
monotonic increase in average returns across the scores, and P3 displays the highest average
excess returns in P3. This could indicate that the score do es not reect any risk or that
investors are unaware of the typ e of risk it reects. We provide additional insight in the
following section.
Second, Tables 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15, show that the linear regression us ing the pricing
factors resp ectively contained in the CAPM, FFC, and FF5 mo dels all grant a statistically
signicant alpha for P5 only (with statistical signicance at the 5% level for CAPM and 1%
level otherwise). Alphas are increasing monotonically across the p ortfolios after controlling
for other sources of risk asso ciated with the pricing factors involved. With this evidence in
mind, the alphas could partly reect the cyb er risk of each p ortfolio. This is, however, not
the case for the cyb er sentiment score in Table 11 since there is no overall strong statistical
signicance or increasing trends when p ortfolios are sorted across this variable.

4.5. Double sorts
We aim to determine if organizing quarterly p ortfolios rst based on sp ecic characteris-
tics and then based on the cyb er score results in a structure in their average excess returns.
The idea is that controlling for additional characteristics rejects the hyp othesis that the cy-
b er scores are a proxy for another rm variable. Thus, the cyb er score would capture the
cyb er risk exp osure and the asso ciated additional returns. In other words, the increasing
cyb er score, which should reect the increasing cyb er risk, still displays increasing related
returns even if the set of rms to analyze is already organized and structured according to
another characteristic unrelated to cyb er risk.
Table 16 displays the average returns of various double-sorted p ortfolios. Notably, there
is a clear increasing trend in average returns as the overall cyb er score quintile increases,
which contrasts with the ndings of Celeny and Marechal (2023), where the trend was less
pronounced. In this analysis, only the rst quintile of the b o ok-to-market ratio do es not
consistently show an increase. Note that Q3 of market b eta and Q5 of the size have a
dierence problem of 0.01% at Q3. However, this quantitatively marginal result may b e
spurious.
For the cyb er sentiment score, as previously observed in Table 11, there are no additional
returns for an increase in the score, so the cyb er sentiment score certainly do es not reect
any risk.
The returns obtained with other cyb er scores display an interesting asp ect. Command
and data manipulation, credential movement, and p ersistence and evasion strongly suggest a
monotonic increasing trend and, therefore, cyb er risks premia, except for the lower quintile,
where the conclusion might seem slightly less evident. However, this is not the cas e for
preparation and reconnaissance, for which the trend is nonmonotonic almost everywhere.
This could suggest two things. It could b e that investors do not acknowledge the risk this
cyb er score reects. Or, it could b e that preparation and reconnaissance do not reect any
risk.

4.6. Cross-sectional tests
We test whether a cyb er score increase drives a return increase in cyb er-based p ortfolios,
controlling for other well-known pricing factors using the regression metho d describ ed in
Fama and MacBeth (1973). Table 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22 displays the results for each
cyb er score using a dierent pricing mo del that include the cyb er score.
The cyb er sentiment score probably reects no meaningful reality regarding the rms;
therefore, constructing p ortfolios based on it reveals no particular structure, as observed in
Table 18. No risk premia is observed for any of the involved pricing factors (including the
cyb er sentiment score), and no statistically s ignicant alpha exists.
The overall cyb er s core on Table 17 displays p ositive additional returns for an increased
cyb er score that is statistically signicant at the 10% level when included as the only ex-
planatory variable or with the market factor and at the 5% level when included with the
pricing factors from Fama and French (1992). However, a collinearity problem app ears for
the fth mo del using additional factors from Fama and French (2015). The cyb er score
aggregated for all the rms of the cyb er-based p ortfolios constructs a factor that might b e
colinear to CMA . Therefore, the statistical signicance of the cyb er score is aected and
strongly reduced. When compared to Celeny and Marechal (2023), they app ear to not suer
from collinearity and have a less high adjusted
R
2
.
The command and data manipulation score on Table 19 grants similar results, also suf-
fering from collinearity. On the contrary, the remaining score in Tables 20, 21 and 22 do
not display collinearity and their resp ective cyb er score app ear statistically s ignicant at the
5% level. Note that on all Tables (except for the cyb er sentiment score), the co ecients of
the cyb er score app ear p ositive, further p ointing toward cyb er scores that eectively reect
cyb er risks rewarded on the market. A standard deviation of the overall cyb er score (0

in Table 3) generates an additional return of 0

4.7. Time series tests
We use the GRS test to examine whether adding the long-short p ortfolio
P
5

P
1 as a
pricing factor enhances the explanatory p ower of the ve-factor mo del of Fama and French
(2015). We want to test if we can globally reduce the unexplained part of returns close to
zero. We conduct four GRS tests on 20 p ortfolios sorted quarterly, on rms' cyb er score,
size, market b eta, and b o ok-to-market, resp ectively.
Tables 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28 display the four GRS tests for each cyb er score of interest.
All tables give similar results, with the probability of alphas b eing commonly zero increasing
as we add the cyb er factor P5-P1 and the average
R
2
increasing. There is an exception
when p ortfolios are s orted on size. Their asso ciated probabilities seem to decrease, but it is
imp ortant to note that the probability is already high b efore adding the cyb er factor. It is
hard to quantify if the alphas are closer to zero when they are already commonly near zero.
Also, note that the dierence of probabilities in the case of market b eta is p ositive but small
compared to the improvement provided by the cyb er factor when explaining the return of
p ortfolios sorted on the cyb er score or the b o ok to market.

4.8. Bayesian asset pricing tests
We conduct an additional test to evaluate the cyb er factor P5-P1 as a reliable pricing
factor. Using the Bayesian GRS (BGRS) test describ ed earlier, we can retrieve the b est
subset of pricing factors among a large set of pricing factors. Figures 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and
21 presents the BGRS test for each cyb er score of interest. Keeping only the subsets with
the higher probabilities at the end of the time range, one can notice that the top ve subsets
always include the cyb er factor (except for the cyb er sentiment score case, where one of
the top ve subsets do es not include the cyb er factor). When considering the cumulative
probabilities asso ciated with each pricing factor, one can see that the cyb er factors have
always presented a growing trend over the years, meaning that the cyb er factors have b ecome
more relevant as a pricing factor over time.

4.9. Additional tests
In this section, we conduct further tests to expand the range and depth of understanding
of the cyb er scores we develop ed. These additional tests aim to identify any p otential
limitations and verify the scores' b ehavior in a real case.
[Insert Table 29 here]
In Table 29, we display the probabilities asso ciated with the dierences in mean returns
b etween the overall and other cyb er-based p ortfolios. Although we give evidence that the
cyb er scores reect dierent realities related to the cyb er sub ject in the 10-Ks, when p ortfolios
30
are constructed from these scores, their returns do not display any statistically signicant
variation across dierent scores. In the context of market p erception of risk, the results
suggest there is no distinction b etween the various domains of cyb er risk, and the market
p erceives a single aggregated risk related to cyb ersecurity.
In Decemb er 2020, a signicant cyb er attack on SolarWinds, a ma jor IT management
company, was uncovered, marking one of the most extensive and sophisticated cyb er es-
pionage op erations. The attackers, b elieved to b e state-sp ons ored, inltrated SolarWinds'
Orion software, which was used by numerous high-prole clients, including Fortune 500 com-
panies and various U.S. government agencies. The attackers gained unprecedented access to
sensitive data across multiple networks by emb edding malicious co de in a routine software
up date. This breach highlighted vulnerabilities within supply chain s ecurity and under-
scored the broader implications for rms at risk of cyb er attacks . The incident serves as a
case study for analyzing the nancial impact on companies deemed to b e cyb er-risky. Such
analysis using this event was p erformed in Florackis et al. (2023) where they analyzed cu-
mulative abnormal returns from their cyb er-based p ortfolios setting the 14 Decemb er 2020,
the day where the attack was disclosed to the SEC, as the t=0 day of the event.
[Insert Table 30 here]
[Insert Figure 22 here]
We conduct a similar analysis on Table 30. None of the abnormal returns were statis-
tically signicant. Figure 22 illustrates the cumulative returns of the cyb er-based p ortfolio
around this event. The results are unconventional. Returns were higher in the lower-tier
cyb er-based p ortfolio in the days leading up to the event. Moreover, when the event o c-
curred, all p ortfolios declined except for P5. However, two imp ortant factors need to b e
considered. First, each p ortfolio aggregates over 600 rms. The SolarWinds breach might
still b e to o nancially lo calized to impact such a large numb er of rms, and the eect could
b e diluted among unaected rms (those not asso ciated with SolarWinds or not p erceived
by the market as aected). Second, none of the variations are statistically signicant, and
opp osing b ehaviors likely mitigate the event's overall impact. For instance, during the sho ck,
investors might have shifted their investments to other sto cks considered safe but still related
to cyb ersecurity, or the event might have increased interest in cyb ersecurity and b o osted in-
vestment in P5 rms.
31
Finally, we display in Tables 31 and 32 the cumulative abnormal returns of P20 and P5
but constructed with dierent cyb er scores. There is not enough statistical signicance to
infer anything. Note that the cumulative returns still reach higher returns in the P20 case
(gure 23) than in the P5 case (Figure 24), and the p ortfolios based on the various cyb er
scores seem to b ehave similarly which supp ort the hyp othesis that the market p erceives a
single aggregated risk related to cyb ersecurity.
These results contrast those of Florackis et al. (2023), who nd a statistically signicant
drop in their top cyb er-based p ortfolio returns around the event.

5. Conclusion
In this study, we use a do c2vec mo del to transform paragraphs of the MITRE ATT&CK
database's descriptions of cyb er attacks into vectors. Comparing those vectors based on
their cosine similarity, we apply clustering metho ds such as K-means, Louvain, and sp ectral
clustering to infer groups of cyb er attacks b elonging to four dened typ es (sup er-tactics):
command and data manipulation, credential movement, p ersistence and evasion and prepa-
ration and reconnaissance. Those clusters were recurrent through dierent trials using the
three metho ds and dierent hyp er-parameters . They were also chosen to preserve the under-
lying written structures of MITRE ATT&CK by using a two-score system that ensures the
equal distribution of paragraphs across sup er-tactics and their exclusivity to these sup er-
tactics. Then, we use the do c2vec mo del to transform paragraphs of annual statements,
more precisely 10-Ks, into vectors. Building the cosine similarity b etween 10-K vectors and
vectors b elonging to sp ecic sup er tactics allows me to infer the semantic similarity of the
10-Ks to the four typ es of cyb er attacks. We dene those cosine similarities as the cyb er
score of a 10-K for a given sup er tactic. We also build an additional cyb er sentiment score.
32
This score considers only paragraphs' cyb er scores when they contain words related to a
\risk" or \uncertainty" vo cabulary.
We nd that the dierent cyb er scores cannot b e unexplained by the linear combination
of standard nancial variables and non-semantic variables of the rms they b elong to (the
highest
R
2
within among all tested cyb er scores is 0.43). The indep endence of those newly
found variables supp orts their innovative nature. All aggregate cyb er scores have increased
over the years and are higher in industry sectors (from the 12 Fama-French industries clas-
sication) involving assisting and workow-related technology like Telephone and Television
Transmission or Business Equipment.
We conduct asset pricing and statistical tests involving p ortfolios sorted on rms' cyb er
scores to assess if the cyb er scores reect cyb er risks. Since all results for each cyb er score
are similar to the overall cyb er score and the previous study Celeny and Marechal (2023)
only used this aggregated cyb er score, we rep ort here only the results related to this score.
This do es not apply to the cyb er sentiment score, for which it app eared clear that no risk
premium was involved.
Organizing rms into p ortfolios based on their cyb er scores allows for the observation
of increasing average excess returns as the p ortfolio's cyb er score increases. The p ortfolio
with the lowest quintile of cyb er score, P1, has an average excess return of 0
:
82%. The
p ortfolio with the highest quintile of cyb er score, P5, has an average excess return of 1
:
44%
(b oth statistically s ignicant at the 1% level). Thus, a long-short p ortfolio P5-P1 destroys
p erformance. Then, controlling for common pricing factors, we nd that P5 has an alpha
of 0
:
29% at the 1% level. Conversely, other p ortfolios, P1 to P4, have increasing alphas but
are statistically insignicant. This threshold in signicance b etween P4 and P5 highlights
the fact that we cannot tell from a rm's cyb er score, at which p oint it truly highlights
cyb er security in its 10-Ks. Therefore, lower p ortfolios contain a variety of rms that may
b e classied according to noise without meaning. We recommend that future studies using a
similar work frame fo cus solely on P5 instead of P5-P1, as has b een done until now. Sorting
the rms into a rst unrelated category and then according to their cyb er score also reveals
a similar structure of returns, as previous ly mentioned, with the top cyb er-based p ortfolios
p erforming b etter. Thus, the structure is robust, controlling for other rm characteristics.
Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions show a risk premium asso ciated with the cyb er
score and all disentangled cyb er scores. In contrast, the cyb er sentiment score do es not drive
33
any risk premium. The GRS test of Gibb ons et al. (1989) shows that the long-s hort p ortfolio
P5-P1 helps to price various assets when used with the other well-known pricing factors of
the ve-factor mo del Fama and French (2015). Furthermore, the BGRS tests from Barillas
and Shanken (2018) also highlight that P5-P1 is an imp ortant cyb er-based pricing factor.
According to the test, this imp ortance is ris ing with time. Interestingly, these observations
are valid for all cyb er scores, including the cyb er sentiment score.
Last, we cannot reject the hyp othesis that the return of P5-P1, built with dierent cyb er
scores, is statistically dierent. Then, we conduct an event study using the cyb er-breach
of SolarWind in Decemb er 2020. The analysis provided no conclusive results, except that
p ortfolios based on dierent cyb er scores b ehave similarly. These last two observations
could prove that the market do es not dierentiate b etween the various typ es of cyb er risk
and p erceives them as a single aggregate cyb er risk. This conclusion is reasonable when we
observe the denition of the four typ es of cyb er attacks. In a sense, they are not mutually
exclusive since, in a cyb er attack, command and data manipulation is the natural next step
of credential movement, which is the next step of p ersistence, and evasion, which is the next
step of preparation and reconnaissance.

Each clustering metho d of Figure 5, 6, and 7 is presented here using the ir resp ective entropy sum and

Also, note that there is no guideline regarding what additional amount is optimal to forfeit to the entropy

Average cyb er score across industries
The resp ective average cyb er scores of e ach rm (from 2009-Q1 to 2023-Q4) are computed and averaged
across the industry the rms b elong to, thus obtaining the dierent averaged cyb er scores aggregate for each
industry. Firms are classied into industries using the Fama-French 12 industry classication.
